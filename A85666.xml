            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Introduction to the Work.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>LL Scripture being the breath of Gods Spirit, <hi>2 Pet. 1.21. 2 Tim. 3.16.</hi> none can be Judge or Expounder of it but the ſame Spirit. Men are only <hi>Indices veritatis,</hi> they cannot bring a ſenſe, but ſhew you what is the ſenſe of Scripture. Thoſe are called to be Expoſitors, muſt not fetch ſenſes <hi>ab extra,</hi> but take what is in the bowels of the Text, and hold forth unto others. A work which requires ability, wiſdome, diligence, and faithfulneſs: Ability to inquire into the originalls; wiſdome to compare Scriptures, conſider circumſtances, and to diſcerne the verity, ſpirituality and propriety of Texts and Phraſes; diligence to dig and ſearch after truth, which lieth deep, and hid; faithfulneſs to give out Truths being found, with their own luſtre, not humane tincture. Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever doth thus, ſhall purchaſe favour in Heaven, if not eſteem on earth. Expoſitory work is ancient and honourable; <hi>Ancient</hi> as <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> time, <hi>Chap. 8.8.</hi> the <hi>Levites</hi> gave the ſenſe of the Law, they expounded it. In thoſe dayes the <hi>Jewes</hi> had their <hi>Peruſhim,</hi> Interpreters, which was above five hundred yeers before Chriſt: what wayes they interpreted Scripture,<note place="margin">Helvicus.</note> you may reade in <hi>Shindl.

               <hi>Luke 24.27.</hi> hee interpreted; and <hi>verſ. 32.</hi> hee opened the Scriptures. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo was an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitor, <hi>Act. 28.23.</hi> he expounded. This work being ſo ancient and honourable, let it finde the more acceptance with you.</p>
            <p>Some would have Expoſitors only give the literall ſenſe without obſervation or application of any thing: if all people could propheſie, were skilfull in Scriptures, as <hi>Ezra,</hi> mighty, as <hi>Apollo,</hi> I could like it. But becauſe many truths lie ſo deep, and ſo cloſely couch'd, as all cannot eaſily diſcern or extract them, it is neceſſary to give the ſenſe, and draw forth points obſervable, yet with a brievous perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity and perſpicuous brevity. The literall ſenſe may be ſtrong meat for ſome, when obſervations may be milk for others. That courſe ſhall I take, and ſo I come to the Title.</p>

               <p>This Book of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> is large, having eight and fourty Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in it, and may rather be called a Volume, then <hi>Sephar,</hi> a Book, a Bill, a Catalogue.

               <p n="3">3. They had the <hi>Megillath</hi> of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> and that they read at the Feaſt of Tabernacles, in memory of Gods protection of them forty yeers in the Wilderneſs, becauſe that volume did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in it many acts of Gods providence which watcheth over his people continually.</p>
               <p>The fourth was the <hi>Megillath</hi> of <hi>Eſther,</hi> which was read in the Moneth of <hi>Adar,</hi> becauſe that diſcovered the plot of <hi>Haman,</hi> and the goodneſs of God that did deliver them from that immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent danger.</p>
               <p>The laſt <hi>Megillath</hi> was the Book of the <hi>Lamentations,</hi> and this contained, as the ſumme, ſo the bewailing of the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity which was grievous unto them. This Book they read in the fifth Moneth which was anſwerable to the latter end of <hi>July.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe were all little books, little volumes, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> is rather a <hi>Megillath,</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel</hi> muſt be one volume, a book written in the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> captivity, ſome five hundred and fourſcore yeers before Chriſt; ſo that it is above two thouſand two hundred yeers ſince this book was written. From hence you may obſerve:</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Wiſdome of God in cauſing this and other books to be written. A book is a writing, the originall word ſignifieth to write. Here is the wiſdome and goodneſs of God, that the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> and other Prophets ſhould be written. God will have his Church furniſhed with, and regulated by written truths, not unwritten traditions: The <hi>Jewes</hi> they had their <hi>Cabbala,</hi> which they ſay were full of ſecret Myſteries. The Papiſts, they have their Traditions, they call them unwritten verities, and wee call them unwritten vanities We have a ſure word of Prophecie to ſtick un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and they uncertain fancies, which corrupt the worſhip of God, and indanger immortall ſouls. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath a whole book <hi>de Verbo Dei non ſcripto,</hi> of the Word of God unwritten; ſuch words of God wee acknowledge not. It was the wiſdome of God that the Prophets ſhould write, and that their writings ſhould be extant.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:123227:12"/> When the Lawyer asked Chriſt what he ſhould do to inherit eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, Chriſt doth not ſend him to unwritten Traditions, or to Jewiſh Cabbala's, but he ſends him to a known and written Law, <hi>What is written in the Law? how readeſt thou?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 10.26.</note> So wee muſt look to what is written, and how we may reade, not what they tell us was revealed to ſuch a Saint, and hath continued to ſo many generations, and is the truth of God: theſe are deluſions. The writings of the Prophets and Apoſtles are ſufficient for us, and wee acknowledge the infinite goodneſs of God, in that theſe ſhould be written for us to have reſort unto. If this Prophets, others, and Apoſtles works had not been written, there would have been great inconveniences; ſome things would have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten; ſome neglected; many things corrupted, and all things in time queſtioned, and ſo the whole truth would have been with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out authority in the hearts of people.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſee here the providence of God likewiſe, in preſerving this book of <hi>Ezekiel;</hi> which was written in <hi>Babylon,</hi> for there was the Prophet, and there he had his viſions: for a book to be preſerved in <hi>Babylon</hi> is a wonder. The Law was loſt in <hi>Sion,</hi> in <hi>Manaſſes</hi> his dayes, and found again in <hi>Joſiah</hi> his time: If the Law may be loſt in <hi>Sion,</hi> much more may a Prophecie be loſt in <hi>Babylon;</hi> and if not loſt in <hi>Babylon,</hi> yet it might have been left in <hi>Babylon;</hi> if not left there, it might have miſcarryed in their return; if not then, yet when <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> took and ſacked <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> it might there have periſhed, and been utterly extinguiſhed, and we never have heard of this Prophecie of <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> But here is the hand of God manifeſted in it, that though this Prophecie were revealed to <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and run through ſo many hazards, yet it ſhould be preſerved to this very day.</p>
               <p>Again, ſee where is the true antiquity: This book was written five hundred and fourſcore yeers before Chriſt, two thouſand two hundred yeers ago, and is not this book now very ancient? other Prophets, and the whole Scripture are the true Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. Papiſts, and many amongſt us ſtand upon antiquity, and what is their antiquity? The Fathers, or ſome Heathen Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, are their antiquity. But what is the true antiquity but the Word of God? That is <hi>Prima veritas,</hi> and <hi>pura veritas,</hi> the firſt truth, and the pure truth, that is the fountain, all other are but
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:123227:13"/> muddy channels. When any points are in controverſie they flie to Fathers and to Antiquity, and what is found there they take for truth: but this is to deſert God, and run to man. <hi>My people have forſaken me the fountain of living waters,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jerem. 2.13.</note> 
                  <hi>and hewed them out ciſrerns, broken ciſterns, that can hold no water.</hi> I am the fountain, ſaith God, my Scriptures are the fountain of living waters, yet they run to their own pits and ciſterns that hold no water. Some moth-eaten and old writings, ſome ancient copies that have lain hid ſome hundreds of yeers from the world, are brought forth, &amp; obtruded upon people for truths, and they muſt be truths. But for your direction, know, that if they be not in the Kings Records, what ever writings they be, never regard them: and if you will ſearch, never ſearch into inferiour Courts, ſearch not books that are on this ſide the Kings Court, that are made of late; but go to the King of heavens Records, have recourſe to his Court, look into the Law of God;<note place="margin">Iſa. 8.20.</note> 
                  <hi>To the Law and to the Teſtimony; if they ſpeak not according to this word, it is becauſe there is no light in them;</hi> throw them by; that truth which is found in any writings, and not to be drawn out of Gods Book, is not from antiquity, theſe are the true Records, here is the true antiquity; And ſo much for this word Book; The Book of the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel.</hi>

                  <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> that is the name of our Prophet. Among the Jewes there were no Sir-names, but every man had onely one name, as <hi>Samuel, David, Iſaiah, Jeremie, Ezekiel, &amp;c.</hi> This name <hi>Ezekiel</hi> doth ſignifie <hi>the ſtrength of God,</hi> or, <hi>one ſtrengthened by God:</hi> He had a great work to doe, he needed great ſtrength for that work. He was to deale with wicked Princes, &amp; wretched people, ſuch as were exceeding oppoſite, deſperately wicked, impudent, hard-hearted, rebellious. Therefore Chap. 3. verſ. 8, 9. <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>I have made thy face ſtrong againſt their faces, and thy fore-head ſtrong againſt their fore-heads, &amp;c.</hi> The Hebrew words here for ſtrong, are <hi>Chazakim</hi> and <hi>Chazak,</hi>

He was to reprove them for their ſinnes, to threaten Gods judgements, to vindicate Gods juſtice in bringing them into captivity, himſelfe was to endure
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:123227:13"/> much hardſhip, and many conflicts, for which ordinary ſtrength would not ſuffice: therefore he is fitly called <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> the ſtrength of God, or a man ſtrengthened of God.</p>

So here, our Prophet was girt up of God from the world, bound in, or to the Spirit, and ſo followed that, which way ſoever it led him.</p>
               <p>Touching this name of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> you may obſerve a note or two.</p>
               <p>Firſt, ſee the wiſedome of God in giving names ſutable to the events that doe follow and fall out afterward. <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was to deale with a ſtubborne people, a rebellious houſe, that did op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe heaven, that did ſtand it out againſt God to the uttermoſt. There was need therefore of a ſtrong Prophet to ſubdue their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious ſpirits. If an ordinary man had come, he would ſoone have been diſcouraged, his ſpirit would have ſunk and fallen within him; therefore here the Lord ordereth it ſo, that a name ſhall be given unto him which ſhall be ſutable to the event, he ſhall be a man of God, he ſhall be ſtrong, ſtrengthened, girt up of God, to deale with a proud, rebellious, obſtinate people.</p>
               <p>You may find in Scripture divers names that have been impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through the wiſedome and guidance of God upon parties before their birth, and the event hath anſwered afterward very fully: as <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. <hi>Thou ſhalt call his name Iſaac. Iſaac</hi> ſignifieth <hi>laughter,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> proved matter of laughter to his father and mother all their dayes, he was a dutifull ſonne, you never read that <hi>Iſaac</hi> fell into ſuch ſinnes as ſome other of the Patriarchs and Prophets fell into. He was a child of laughter to them. So 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22.9. <hi>His name ſhall be Solomon, for I will give peace and quietneſs unto Iſrael in his dayes:</hi> and the event was anſwerable to his name. So <hi>Joſiah,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13.2. it ſignifies <hi>the fire of the Lord,</hi> and <hi>Joſiah</hi> was the fire of God indeed to make a reformation, to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:123227:14"/> pull downe <hi>Jeroboams</hi> Altar, and to offer upon it the Prieſts of the high places that had burnt Incenſe upon it, to burn mens bones thereon, to throw out idolatry, and to deſtroy the high places. So the name of our bleſſed Saviour which was impoſed before his birth, <hi>Thou ſhalt call his name Jeſus, They ſhall call his name Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel,</hi> he ſhall ſave his people, he ſhall be God with us, and it was ſo. <hi>Luke</hi> 1. <hi>Call his name John. John</hi> noteth <hi>Gracious,</hi> and he was gracious in the eyes of his very enemies, he had favour in the eyes of <hi>Herod,</hi> favour in the eyes of the people.

               <p>The Prophets (to ſpeak for the honour of this our Prophet) were all honourable men, men of great eſteem and worth, they were men of God, as it is ſaid, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 17.24. <hi>I know thou art a man of God, Iſh Elohim,</hi> a man of the Gods, a man of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a man of God the Son, a man of God the Holy Ghoſt, hee had to do with all, a man of Gods counſell, a man of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, a man of Gods countenancing, a man of God that ſtood for God, a man of God that would plead the cauſe of God in the corrupteſt times, againſt the deſperate enemies. A Prophet was a man of God.</p>
               <p>That they were very honourable, you ſhall find by that paſſage, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.11. <hi>Is Saul alſo among the Prophets?</hi> It is a Proverbiall ſpeech, and noteth a thing that is very rare and unuſuall; What, is <hi>Saul</hi> that was a man of mean condition, <hi>Saul</hi> that was erewhile ſeeking his fathers Aſſes; is <hi>Saul</hi> now come to ſo high and honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a condition, as to be a mong the Prophets?

               <p>
                  <hi>Jeremy</hi> having prophecied of the captivity of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty yeers, the utter ruine of the City and Temple; many, both in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi> (the captivity being begun, for now <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel</hi> and divers were in <hi>Babylon</hi>) murmured and complained of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy,</hi> that he was a falſe Prophet; that hee had not the Spirit of God; that hee had miſled the people; that he had brought them into bondage by his fair words, put them upon yeelding unto the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and betrayed them: You ſhall finde falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets beſtirred themſelves, and oppoſed his prophecy both in <hi>Sion</hi> and in <hi>Babylon,</hi> as <hi>Jer.</hi> 28.1, 2, 3. <hi>Hananiah</hi> being at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was in the houſe of the Lord, in the preſence of the Prieſts and of all the people, ſaith he, <hi>Thus ſpeaketh the Lord of Hoſts, the God of Iſrael, ſaying, I have broken the yoak of the King of Babylon; within two full yeers will I bring again into this place all the veſſels of the Lords houſe that Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon took away from this place, and carryed them to Babylon; And I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the ſonne of Jehoiakim, King of Judah, with all the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of Judah that went into Babylon.</hi> Here is a falſe Prophet contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts all that <hi>Jeremiah</hi> had ſpoken, touching the ſeventy yeers cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity.</p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:123227:16"/>
               <p>The falſe Prophets likewiſe in <hi>Babylon,</hi> they were at work, and they ſtrengthen the hands of the falſe Prophets at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by their doctrine, <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.8, 9. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, the God of Iſrael, Let not your Prophets and your Diviners that be in the midst of you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you, neither hearken to your dreams which you cauſe to be dreamed, for they prophecy falſly unto you in my name, I have not ſent them, ſaith the Lord.</hi> And in the 24, 25, 26, 27, 28. verſes of the ſame Chapter, you ſhall find, that <hi>Shemaiah</hi> the <hi>Nehelamite,</hi> ſent Letters from <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> to all the Prieſts, and to all the people that were at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> accuſing <hi>Jeremiah</hi> for a mad man, for making himſelf a Prophet, for ſending Letters to them in <hi>Babylon,</hi> for lengthening out the captivity to ſeventy yeers, for incouraging them to build houſes, to plant gardens, to eat the fruit of them, he would have <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> impriſoned and ſet in the ſtocks.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was accuſed, cryed down at home and abroad, his prophecy was ſleighted, ſcorned by many, and moſt were troubled at what <hi>Jeremiah</hi> had prophecied: This made ſuch work, both at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and at <hi>Babylon,</hi> that the people of God were much deſpondent, and their enemies mightily inſultive: Now hereupon the Lord ſtirreth up <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> powreth out his Spirit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him calleth him forth to prophecy, ſetteth him a work to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and to ratifie what he had fore-told concerning the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> captivity, threatning ruine to the City and Temple, to Kingdome and King, to their Nobles, Prieſts and all the people.</p>
               <p>Hereupon, (ſaith <hi>Joſephus</hi>) the prophecy of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> as ſoon as ever it was written (I conceive he meaneth not the whole Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but ſome part of it) was ſent to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but little fruit came of it; For <hi>Zedekiah</hi> being then King, and having ſeen it, he would neither believe <hi>Jeremy</hi> nor <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> but preſently concludes, that both were lyers and falſe Prophets; and that upon this ground; <hi>Jeremiah</hi> had ſaid, Chap. 21.7. that <hi>Zedekiah</hi> ſhould be carryed captive into <hi>Babylon;</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel</hi> denyed that he ſhould ſee <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> Chapt. 12.13. Hereupon, ſaith <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> they were both falſe, here is a contradiction, the one ſaith, I ſhall be carryed into <hi>Babylon,</hi> the other ſaith, I ſhall not ſee <hi>Babylon.</hi> But God quickly made this good,<note place="margin">2 King. 25.7.</note> for ſhortly after, <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> came, beſieged <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> took <hi>Zedekiah</hi> captive, put out both his eyes, bound him with fetters of braſs, carried him to <hi>Babylon,</hi> which he never ſaw.</p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:123227:16"/>
               <p>From hence by the way you may obſerve; firſt, upon what ſleight and weak grounds Princes and people will caſt off prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and truths of God, even upon miſtakes and miſapprehenſions. <hi>Zedekiah</hi> could not apprehend what truths there were in theſe two prophecies, had he compared one thing with another, hee might eaſily have ſeen truth; but ſmall matters will make Princes and people turn off the truths of God, eſpecially when they are not ſutable to their own ſpirits; and in theſe dayes people can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much ado turn off any truths Miniſters bring, if they be not ſutable to their apprehenſions and fancies.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That God will make good the word of his Miniſters and Prophets, though they ſeem contradictory to mens fancies and ſenſe. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Zedekiah</hi> ſhall go into <hi>Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel</hi> ſaith he ſhall not ſee <hi>Babylon:</hi> God makes it good notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the prophecy is thrown away. The word of God ſhall take hold upon Princes, Nobles, people, and ſlay them if they have deſpiſed and ſtood out againſt it.</p>
               <p>But from this generall ſcope of <hi>Ezekiels</hi> prophecy, that hee is ſent to ſtrengthen and juſtifie <hi>Jeremy,</hi> take this obſervation, That it is good for Miniſters to ſtrengthen the doctrine, works, hands and hearts one of another. A Prophet is queſtioned, trod under foot, his prophecy thrown out as falſe; an <hi>Ezekiel</hi> is ſtirred up to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie a <hi>Jeremy:</hi> When Miniſters juſtifie one another, the work goes on with more ſtrength; when there is a double witneſs to a truth, it will ſeal it more ſtrongly to the heart. God gave foure Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts; one had been a great mercy; but that things might be rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in your hearts, ſealed up in your conſciences, you have foure Euangeliſts, each one ſtrengtheneth the doctrine and things of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: So the conſent of Miniſters and Prophets is a great matter to ratifie truths in the hearts and conſciences of people, and to eſtabliſh the Church. It is good therefore for an <hi>Ezekiel</hi> to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then a <hi>Jeremy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. More ſpecially the ſcope of the Prophet is, to comfort the captives that were then in <hi>Babylon;</hi> for they began now to be troubled that they had hearkened to <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> yeelded to the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> becauſe <hi>Jeremy</hi> had prophecied that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhould be deſtroyed, the Temple burnt, and that all ſhould be laid waſte, whereas <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſtood ſtill; and now five yeers were gone,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:123227:17"/> and nothing done unto the City or Temple (for it was in the fifth yeere of <hi>Jehoiachins</hi> captivity, that <hi>Ezekiel</hi> began his Prophecie) They now began to be diſcouraged that they had left their habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, that they had hearkned to <hi>Ieremy</hi> ſo far, as to come to <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon:</hi> they were likewiſe diſheartened in <hi>Babylon,</hi> they met with much hardſhip there, being put upon building, planting, ſowing, and other difficulties,: yea, the <hi>Babylonians</hi> themſelves ſcoffed at them, and ſaid, <hi>Sing us one of your ſongs of Sion.</hi> This made them to droop, and to wiſh, O that we were at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> again, that we had never hearkened to <hi>Ieremy.</hi> The <hi>Iewes</hi> alſo at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched them, and they ſaid, they were men of cowardly and baſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, diſcouraged with the words of a timerous and lying Prophet, one <hi>Ieremy,</hi> and thereupon yeelding themſelves into the hands of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> they wretchedly betrayed the City, Religion and their Countrey; theſe things went to the very bowels and reins of the godly, and did greatly diſturb them. Hereupon the Lord, to ſupport, their ſpirits, to comfort them in theſe their diſtreſſes, and to be an <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> even the ſtrength of God unto them, ſtirreth up <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> ſets him on work.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the ſcope of the Prophet is the ſame with the reſt of the Prophets, <hi>viz.</hi> to lead unto Chriſt, as you may ſee by reading, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.44. <hi>Act.</hi> 3.18.21.24. They ſpake of Chriſt, and led to him; but it is more eſpecially aimed at by this our Prophet, who begins with the Law executed, a Captivity, but ends with a Temple, and reſtauration by Chriſt, thereby leading the people that were captives in <hi>Babylon,</hi> to Chriſt the King of <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> In <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.10.<note place="margin">

                     </gap>.</note> you have this expreſſion, <hi>That he might gather together in one, all things in Chriſt,</hi> the word notes, to ſumme up, or to make a brief collection of the heads of all that was ſpoken before; implying, that much hath been ſaid of Chriſt by others, and that the chief heads of all ſhould be ſummed up, brought together, and be found in Chriſt. Much was ſpoken by <hi>David</hi> of Chriſt, much by <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> much by <hi>Ieremy, Zachariah, Ezekiel;</hi> now the ſumme of all that is in them, and in the reſt, ſhall be gathered together as in one head, you ſhall meet it all in Jeſus Chriſt; He is the Magazine and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury of all their ſtrength and wealth, the chief things that ever have been ſpoke by the Prophets formerly, they are all concentred in him. He is the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega;</hi> the <hi>Alpha</hi> of <hi>Geneſis, The ſeed
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:123227:17"/> of the woman ſhall break the Serpents head;</hi> and the <hi>Omega</hi> of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations, The grace of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt be with you all.</hi> So that all between <hi>Geneſis</hi> and the <hi>Revelation,</hi> leads either directly or col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laterally unto Jeſus Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. <hi>The Prophets prophecied of grace that ſhould come unto you, ſearching when, or what manner of time the Spirit of Chriſt which was in them did ſignifie, when it teſtified before-hand the ſufferings of Chriſt, and the glory that ſhould follow.</hi> See here, they ſhewed you the grace that ſhould come, the Spirit teſtified in them of the ſufferings of Chriſt, and of the glory that ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. They were <hi>Seers,</hi> and they ſaw Chriſt, and the glory of Chriſt, and they lead the people up to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thus you have the ſcope and occaſion of our Prophets pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying and writing; it was to convince them of the heavie cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity of ſeventy yeers, to ſtrengthen <hi>Ieremyes</hi> prophecy, to incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the Church of God in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and to lead them unto Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the next place we are to ſhew you the nature and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Prophecy, which is full of Majeſty, obſcurity and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty. <hi>Nazianzen</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Orat.</hi> 23.</note> That <hi>Ezekiel</hi> is the chiefeſt of all the reſt for matter of admiration, and acuteneſs he is the greateſt of all the Prophets, and the deepeſt; which made <hi>Ierome</hi> ſay, there was in this Prophecy of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> a ſea of Scripture, hee is ſo deep, a laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth of the myſteries of God, he is ſo dark, ſo difficult; if he do but equalize other Prophets in dignity and worth, yet he exceeds them in difficulty and darkneſs. It muſt be ſaid of this Prophet, as of <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>There are ſome things in them hard to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,</hi> and ſo there are many things in this Prophet which are hard to be underſtood: There are ſome ſtrange words in him, ſuch as are no where elſe in Scripture to be found: He hath dark viſions in him, ſuch as will exerciſe the greateſt abilities in the world to find out the aim of God, and thoſe truths that are wrapped up in them; he hath uncertain Chronologies and Chorographies, my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall Parables, forain Hiſtories, and many tranſcendent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which may awaken your attention, and do call for the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt of mans induſtry in the opening.</p>
               <p>Hence it was counted raſhneſs for any one to read this Prophet till he was thirty yeers of age. And <hi>Ierome</hi> tels us,<note place="margin">Maldonat.</note> that it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited among the <hi>Iewes,</hi> that any ſhould read the beginning of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> the book of <hi>Canticles,</hi> the beginning or ending of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:123227:18"/> till he were thirty yeers of age.<note place="margin">Ante aetatem ſacerdotalem.</note> The <hi>Rabbins</hi> think it not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to interpret this Prophet, but only by touching ſome generall things in it; particular things might not be deſcended into. One ſaith,<note place="margin">A Lapid.</note> 
                  <hi>Ezekiel</hi> is <hi>Ieremy</hi> vail'd, a hand ſhut up, and you know not what is in it; like a book ſealed up, and none can open it, or knowes what is written within. Theſe expreſſions have been uſed to ſet forth the darkneſs and difficulty of our Prophet.</p>
               <p>And I will appeal unto you all this day, that if that queſtion were put to you, when you ſhall read this Prophet, which <hi>Philip</hi> once put to the Eunuch,<note place="margin">Acts 8.30.31.</note> 
                  <hi>Vnderſtand you what you read?</hi> might you not all anſwer without bluſhing, <hi>How ſhall we underſtand without a guide?</hi> And who is ſufficient to guide your underſtandings through this difficult and dark Prophecy? For mine own part I durſt not have ventured to launch into this deep, unleſs I had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted unto it: And being called unto it, I deſire to go out in the ſtrength of the Lord, and to be as a Star in his hand, guided by his Spirit, to lead you through the difficulties of this Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall Prophet.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, If this Prophet be ſo difficult and dark, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hee is not ſeaſonable, nor ſutable to theſe times; ſome other Scripture might have had the preheminence.</p>
               <p>For this, take two or three anſwers: Firſt, I finde that many Interpreters have fallen upon this Prophet in troubleſome and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous times. <hi>Gregory</hi> the great, he writ and preached upon this Prophet, when the <hi>Barbarians</hi> were almoſt at the gates of <hi>Rome,</hi> and when the ſword was devouring multitudes. <hi>Ierome</hi> likewiſe ſtudied and writ upon this Prophet, what time <hi>Alaricus,</hi> King of the <hi>Goths,</hi> took <hi>Rome</hi> and waſted all, and filled the Chriſtian world with teares and blood. <hi>Calvin</hi> that great Light of <hi>Europe,</hi> ſpent his laſt breath upon this Prophet, and in times that were not very peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but ſtirring and troubleſom. <hi>Lavaters</hi> Lectures upon this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet were together with the commotions in <hi>France;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gallicis tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multibus.</note> and he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth, that he did the more willingly give up himſelf to the ſtudy of this Prophet, that ſo hee might free his ſpirit, from the ſad thoughts of the publike and private miſchiefs which were in his dayes, and acknowlegdeth this was a remedy to him againſt many evills.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I anſwer, that compare our times a little with the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:123227:18"/> times and ſtate of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and wee ſhall ſee ſome ſeaſonableneſs in handling this Prophet at this time.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The ſins the Prophet cryes out of amongſt them, are rife a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us; the ſins then were Idolatry, Superſtition, oppreſſion, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in the worſhip of God, luxury, uncleanneſs, prophaneneſs, ſcorning at goodneſs, hiding their eyes from the Lords Sabbaths, and the like. Now I ask, are not all theſe ſins alive, and too luſty in our Kingdome at this time, and in this City wherein we live?</p>
               <p n="2">2. There was then a malignant party which was active and at work, and did oppoſe and hinder the reformation (what lay in them) which was on foot by <hi>Ieremy,</hi> by <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> by the three <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> by <hi>Bacuch,</hi> by the <hi>Rechabites;</hi> all theſe and many others op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the corruptions of the times, &amp; laboured to have a reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the worſhip of God, to bring the people back again from their corrupt wayes to the Lord; but there was a great oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the malignant party, and the chief oppoſers then were the Prieſts, and the falſe Prophets, who poyſoned the judgements of the people, who ſuggeſted falſe things unto them, who fed them with vain hopes, with corrupt opinions and deceivable doctrines: the chief of the Prieſts were chiefeſt in malignancy and oppoſition, this you ſhall ſee, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.14, 15, 16. <hi>All the chief of the Prieſts and the people tranſgreſſed very much, they polluted the houſe of the Lord, they mocked the meſſengers of God, deſpiſed his words, and miſuſed his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets;</hi> this was the practice of thoſe times; Was there ever any great diſorder, corruption in the Church, or any ſedition, treaſon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in the State, but ſome of the chief of the Prieſts have had their hands in it? When the Calf was ſet up in <hi>Moſes</hi> his dayes, <hi>Aaron</hi> the Prieſt had his head and hand in it; when <hi>David</hi> was a dying, <hi>Adonijah</hi> makes the ſedition and ſtir in the Kingdome, but <hi>Abiathar</hi> the Prieſt had a great hand in it? Both in the State and in the Church you may well obſerve, that the chief of the Prieſts have had their hands in the evill, in the trouble. And have not we now a malignant party that oppoſe the reformation intended and begun? Do they not ſet themſelves with all their might againſt the <hi>Ieremies, Daniels, Ezekiels,</hi> and <hi>Rechabites</hi> of the Land that will not defile themſelves? There is ſuch a party, you all know, that do oppoſe godlineſs, that deſpiſe the Prophets, ſcorne the Saints, make ſad the hearts of the righteous, and ſtrengthen the hands
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:123227:19"/> of wickedneſs, therefore this prophecy may be ſeaſonable enough in regard of that malignant party that doth oppoſe too openly.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They had loſt their countrey, their choyſeſt comforts, they were in captivity and conſtant jeopardy of their lives, if they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> they were ready to fall upon them, and root them out preſently; and thoſe at <hi>Ieruſalam</hi> were in danger every day to have their liberties, eſtates, conſciences, Religion, and lives taken from them; And are not we like unto them? and are not we even in a Land of liberty in a ſtate of captivity? Do not our eſtates, our liberties, our conſciences, our Religion, our lives, and all lie at the ſtake? Wee are even in <hi>Babylon</hi> in the midſt of <hi>Sion;</hi> wee are in a ſad and heavie condition; therefore this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy may be ſeaſonable now, conſidering our eſtate is ſo like to theirs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The times then were ſuch, that they loathed Manna, ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and plain truths would not down, unleſs truths were new and tranſcendent, they were weary of them, and ſlighted them; <hi>Ieremy</hi> was too plain a Prophet for them, too low, and God gives them <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> a dark and hard Prophet. And is it not ſo in theſe dayes? we have been fed with Manna ſo long, that we loath Manna, as a wormy thing; If we have not ſomething new, unheard of, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent, we are weary, wee think it not worth our going out of doors, if ſo, then here is a Prophet that may be ſutable to theſe times, and your deſires; God gave them this Prophet in a time of affliction, and there was ſomething in it; for afflictions open mens underſtandings,<note place="margin">Vexatio dat intellectum.</note> and inlarge their capacities: when people are under preſſures, then their underſtandings are quickeſt, then they are moſt apprehenſive: therefore God gave them ſuch a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet as might ſute with their condition, in exerciſing their parts and graces to the full, when at the beſt. Now is a time of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if your ſpirits be awakened, and the bent of them be after high and hard things, lo, here are difficulties and tranſcendencies for you; here are high things to draw up your thoughts, to exerciſe your ſpirits, be they never ſo choice and apprehenſive.</p>
               <p>One thing more for the ſeaſonableneſſe of this Prophet, it is ſaid heaven was open, &amp; <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſaw viſions of God. If ever God hath opened heaven ſince Chriſt, now he hath done it in theſe ſad times; God hath now cauſed, &amp; is cauſing you every day to ſee viſions out
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:123227:19"/> of the Prophets, and out of the Goſpel. Theſe expoſitory Lectures are openings of heaven, and let out cleare and choice light un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you from heaven; therefore ſeeing heaven is opened, let viſions of God be counted ſeaſonable, and become acceptable unto you.</p>
               <p>But if this Prophet be ſo dark and difficult, what is the benefit and fruit we ſhall have by him?</p>
               <p>This is the next head wee are to come unto, and the benfits of this Prophet are theſe: the darker the Prophet is, the more of God may you look for from him. God dwelleth in darkneſs, as well as in light. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 18.11. <hi>He made darkneſſe his ſecret place.</hi> And <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.9. <hi>God came to Moſes in a thick cloud,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tenebrae ſunt latibulum D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>i.</note> and there <hi>Moſes</hi> had the moſt of God. Here God is coming to you in a dark Prophet, and queſtionleſs you ſhall find much of God in him; here you ſhall ſee much of Gods mercy in upholding and comforting the ſpirits of his people, and providing for them in a ſtrange land; here you ſhall ſee much of Gods juſtice in puniſhing ſinners for their ſins and iniquities; here you ſhall ſee much of Gods truth in fulfilling of prophecies; here you ſhall finde much of Gods power in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting of Kings and Kingdomes; here you ſhall finde much of his manifold Wiſdome in theſe dark viſions; here you ſhall finde more of God then you expect.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This prophecy is an exact Hiſtory of the time of the <hi>Jewes</hi> being in captivity; in it you have many paſſages, of <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zars</hi> reign and government, of his acts abroad and at home, and of Gods dealing with his people in the time of this their ſeventy yeers captivity. Were not <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel</hi> extant, wee ſhould have ſuch a great loſſe as the world could not tel how to repair it; the acts of Gods dealing with his Church and people in that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty yeers, would be ſwallowed up in a <hi>Chaos</hi> of darkneſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You ſhall ſee for what ſins God ſubverteth and overthroweth Kingdomes and States. In this Prophet you ſhall find, that the Lord doth ruine glorious Churches, great Cities, mighty King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, men of great renown, families and poſterities, and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſins for which he doth it; Namely, for falſe worſhip, Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, injuſtice, uncleanneſſe, prophaning of his Sabbaths, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of his Word, abuſe of his Prophets, and ſins of that nature. So that as it is, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.30. <hi>There is no wiſdome, no counſel, nor under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding againſt the Lord.</hi> God will overthrow even Kings and their
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:123227:20"/> Councels, Kingdoms with their Nobility and Gentry, with their Magiſtrates and people; God will overthrow them when he once ſets upon ſuch a worke, ſuch a deſigne: There is no ſtanding out againſt him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. You ſhall ſee here alſo the different carriage betweene the godly and the wicked, in times of Judgement. When judgements are abroad in the world, the inhabitants of the earth ſhould learn righteouſneſs; but wicked men they grow more active againſt God, more impudent, more deſperate and hard-hearted; they combine and plot together to roote out the righteous: this you ſhall ſee in this Prophecie. And for the godly, you ſhall finde that when judgements are neare and upon them, they are mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſecret, they get together, they that feare God ſpeake often one to another; they faſt, they pray, they redeeme the time, they worke out their ſalvation with feare and trembling, they give God no reſt, they will be at it at midnight: In a word, you ſhall finde the carriage of the godly to be exceeding contrary to the carriage of the wicked.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Here you ſhall find Gods new Covenant, wherein you ſhall ſee the riches of free grace, God doing all, both making the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and performing it, both commanding and giving what he doth command unto your ſoules.</p>
               <p n="6">6. You ſhall finde that this Prophet is an Evangelicall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, for he points at Chriſt, he will ſhew you where he is, he will lead you to the Temple, where you ſhall ſee Chriſt with his line in his hand, and meaſuring out a Temple for the times of the Goſpel, meaſuring of his worſhip, his worſhippers, and all that doth concerne the new <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Much of Chriſt will be found at leaſt in the concluſion of this Prophet.</p>
               <p n="7">7. You ſhall have a lively repreſentation of the uncertainty of all things, and of all conditions in this world. In <hi>Lament.</hi> 4.12. it is ſaid there, that the Kings of the earth and all the Inhabitants of the world, would not have beleeved, that the adverſary and the enemy ſhould have entred into the gates of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> None thought, none of the Kings of the earth, none of the Kings of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> beleeved that ever <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which was ſo fortified by moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines round about, ſhould be taken by the enemy: But you ſhall ſee in this Prophet, that even <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Citie of God, the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:123227:20"/> Temple that was the glory of the world, and <hi>Sion</hi> the perfection of beauty, they are all laid waſt: Neither Prince, Prieſt, Prophet, Nobles, nor any are ſpared, but all are deſtroyed, all are carried into captivitie, all are brought under, the ſonnes, the precious ſonnes of <hi>Sion</hi> are carried away into <hi>Babylon.</hi> So that there is no place, no condition, no prerogative that can priviledge any from the hand of God where once ſinne is come to a perfection.<note place="margin">Prov. 14.34.</note> 
                  <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs exalteth a Nation, but ſinne is a reproach to any people.</hi> Let them be Jewes or Gentiles, let them be Kings, Prieſts, or Prophets, when ſin is growne to a height, then the wrath of God comes to a perfection, and God will lay a <hi>Sion</hi> waſt, God will raze a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, God will carry a <hi>Iehojakin,</hi> a <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> Prince and Prophet, Prieſt and People into captivitie. Is <hi>Sion</hi> gone? is the Temple ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed? is <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> laid in the duſt? What confidence then can any Kingdome, can any Citie have? Let not <hi>England,</hi> let not <hi>London</hi> be ſecure. Feare and Tremble. Repent of ſinne. Take heed of provoking God. Looke beyond the Kingdomes of the earth. Looke up to heaven, and make ſure of that Kingdome which cannot be ſhaken, which cannot be taken from you. Thus you have ſome of the benefits that are to come by this Prophet.</p>
               <p>We are now to fall upon the generall diviſion of the Prophecy.</p>
               <p>In this Prophet you have,
<list>

                           <item>2. Threatning of judgement and deſtruction to ſeverall Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that had inſulted over the people of God, being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away captive, and the hand of God being upon them: theſe were the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> the <hi>Moabites,</hi> the <hi>Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi> the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> and <hi>Babylonians:</hi> And this he doth from the 25. to the 33.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Now]</hi> The word in the Originall is <hi>And; And it came to paſſe.</hi> It ſeemes a ſtrange beginning of a booke; eſpecially when it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres to nothing ſaid or writ before. There are many of the books of ſacred Writ begin on this manner; as <hi>Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Ioſuah, Ruth, Samuel, Kings,</hi> and divers others. In hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:123227:21"/> books, it may note the ſeries, connect things antecedent with things conſequent: but in propheticall books, it cannot note or make a connexion with things foregoing. <hi>Jonas</hi> begins his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy ſo, and what was the antecedent to make up the conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion? Here is the <hi>Quere,</hi> and difficultie, why the Prophet ſhould begin his book on this manner, <hi>And it came to paſſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some ſatisfie the doubt thus. They make it an idiome or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietie of the Hebrew tongue, to begin books with this particle, <hi>And,</hi> or <hi>Now;</hi> and ſo they make nothing of it. But ſurely this is not all, there is ſomething wrapped up in this <hi>Now,</hi> or <hi>And,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Van.</note> which may be of inſtruction and uſe to us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Now,</hi> or, <hi>And it came to paſſe.</hi> The Prophet doubtleſs was me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating upon the condition he was in; meditating of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he had been in. Time was that we were at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that we went with joy to the Temple, to the ſolemne Aſſemblies, that we heard the voyce of God, that we ſaw his glory, his beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, his power and his ſtrength there: Time was that we had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Saints; that we ſung ſongs of <hi>Sion</hi> together with chearfulnes and with joy; we had precious Ordinances, honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Sabbaths, Sacrifices that did cheare our hearts, and ſeale up pardon of our ſinnes to us, and intimate the good will of God in Chriſt to our ſoules; wee ſate under our Vines and under our fig-trees, and were in ſafetie. But now, now we eate the bread of mourners, wee drinke our own teares; Now wee are deprived of all Ordinances, ſtript of all our comforts; wee are ſold into the hands of enemies, wee are become captives to a heathen Prince; our bondage is grievous, and muſt continue ſeventy years. It is the fruit of our ſinne. God is righteous in all his judgements, and if we willingly accept the puniſhment of our iniquitie, he will in wrath remember mercy, regard us in our low eſtate, he will ſweeten and ſanctifie our captivitie to us.</p>
                     <p>Such thoughts as theſe were in the breaſt of the Prophet. And I incline the rather to thinke ſo, becauſe it was upon the Sabbath day (as I ſhall ſhew you afterwards when I come to open ſome things that follow) when he was meditating on this manner. Alſo you ſhall finde in Scripture relatives uſed without antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents; as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 87.1. <hi>His foundation is in the holy Mountaines.</hi> Here is a relative without any antecedent, yet the antecedent is

                        <pb n="24" facs="tcp:123227:23"/> ſuppoſed, and eaſily found out. <hi>His foundation,</hi> whoſe foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? the foundation of the Temple, the foundation of the Citie is in the <hi>holy Mountaines.</hi> The Scripture doth ſometime lay downe things relatively and conjunctively, when the antecedent may be ſuppoſed and found out with a little inquiry. So here, <hi>And</hi> it was thus and thus with the Prophet, he was meditating, there was the Word in his boſome, and the particle <hi>And</hi> connects that with this Word of God revealed to him and expreſt by him.</p>
                     <p>Hence then take this note: That the hearts of the ſervants of God are exerciſed with thoughts of Gods dealings with the Church and themſelves. Their thoughts are better exerciſed then the world thinks. <hi>Ezekiel</hi> here had his thoughts buſied about his former and preſent condition, his heart was exerciſed that way. <hi>I have other meate to eate</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>then yee know of;</hi> So the Saints, they have other meat, other thoughts to feed upon then the world takes notice of; It is oft unknown how their thoughts are exerciſed. <hi>Eli</hi> thought <hi>Hanna</hi> madde when he ſaw her lips goe; but her heart was better employed then he fancied. Many thinke Gods people melancholy, and not worthy of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, they are but heavy pieces, when their hearts are in heaven, and they are at ſolid and ſerious converſe with God. You have an expreſſion to this purpoſe in <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Let him kiſſe me with the kiſſes of his mouth.</hi> The Spouſe had not ſpoke of her <hi>Beloved</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. It is a ſtrange ſpeech to begin thus; <hi>Let him kiſſe me with, &amp;c.</hi> Who ſhould kiſſe her? here is no mention of Chriſt, no mention of God, no mention of any before, but on a ſuddaine, <hi>Let him kiſſe me with, &amp;c.</hi> Though Chriſt had not been mentioned by her lips, yet Chriſt was deep in her thoughts, and in her deſires, ſhee had meditated on Chriſt before, and ſo breakes out into this ſpeech, <hi>Let him kiſſe me with, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Ezekiel</hi> having his heart meditating, and taken up with the thoughts of his former and preſent condition, of the Church in generall, of Gods wrath to them, and Gods mercy in the middeſt of his wrath, breaks out, <hi>And,</hi> or now, in the thirtieth <hi>yeare it was ſo and ſo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This then inſtructs us what is the practice of the choice Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies of God, their hearts are meditating and taken up with divers things that the world is not aware of. It is good for us to be in meditation this way: <hi>Iſaac</hi> he went out to meditate in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:123227:23"/> and while he was meditating cometh <hi>Rebekah,</hi> the deſire of his ſoul; and the Prophet being in that poſture, hath viſions of God to cheare his ſoul, and the ſouls of his people. If you would be meditating, you may ſee heaven opened, and God coming down into your boſomes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In the thirtieth yeere.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This time doth trouble Interpreters very much; It is not ſaid in the thirtieth yeere of what, or of whom, but barely in the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth yeere. Here is an uncertain Chronologie, which makes a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in the Prophet.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>In the thirtieth yeer;</hi> not the thirtieth yeer from the Jubilee, as ſome do make it, for the fifth yeer of <hi>Jehoiachins</hi> captivity cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponds not with the thirtieth from the Jubilee; for as <hi>Junius,</hi> and ſome others (that take pains in ſearching out the truth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in) do obſerve, that falls in but with the ninth yeer from the Jubilee; therefore we let that paſs.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>In the thirtieth yeer.</hi> Some make this to be the thirtieth yeer of his age, the Prophet was thirty yeers old, and then he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to prophecy. But this is not the practice of the Pen-men of Scripture, to compute the prophecies from their own age and birth; and there is good reaſon for it, becauſe prophecies and things that do concern the good of the Church ſo neerly and ſo much, do receive witneſs and ſtrength from the time wherein they are extant, and thoſe times muſt not be particular times, times of particular men that are not known, but the times muſt be ſuch as arr known to the world, that all may be convinced the thing was done at ſuch a time: now the birth of one that afterward was to be a Prophet, is not like to be a time ſo noted in the world, that the world then ſhould take notice that <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was born, and did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the computation of his prophecy from thence. It is not like therefore that this ſhould be the meaning of the thirtieth yeere; If ſo, he would have ſaid in the thirtieth yeere of my life.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>In the thirtieth yeer.</hi> That is, in the thirtieth yeer ſince the Law was found in <hi>Joſiah</hi> his dayes, and ſince that great Paſſeover which was kept by him. In the 2 <hi>King.</hi> 22. there is mention of find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the book of the Law, and in <hi>Chapt.</hi> 23. of the great Paſſeover, and this was in the eighteenth yeer of <hi>Joſiah</hi> his reign, <hi>verſe</hi> 33.</p>
                     <p>Now if we compute the time from the eighteenth yeer of <hi>Joſiah,</hi>
                        <pb n="26" facs="tcp:123227:24"/> it doth amount even to the thirtieth yeer in which our Prophet had his viſion, and began his prophecy: For <hi>Joſiah</hi> reigned thirteen yeers after this (as you may obſerve in the Story) <hi>hee raigned thirty and one yeers</hi> in all, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 22.1. and then <hi>Iehoahaz</hi> his ſon raigned three moneths, <hi>Chapt.</hi> 23.31. then <hi>Iehoiakim</hi> reigned eleven yeers, <hi>verſ.</hi> 36. and <hi>Iehoiachin</hi> his ſon reigned three months before he was carried captive into <hi>Babylon,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 King. 24.</note> and five yeers of his captivity was paſt when <hi>Ezekiel</hi> began his prophecy. So then take the thirteen yeeres of <hi>Joſiah,</hi> the eleven yeers of <hi>Iehoiakim,</hi> there is twenty four, then adde the five yeers of <hi>Iehoiachins</hi> captivity, that makes twenty nine, and then tahe three moneths that <hi>Iehoahaz</hi> reigned, and the three moneths that <hi>Iehoiachin</hi> reigned before hee was carried cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, it makes up twenty nine yeers and ſix moneths, therefore ſaith he in the thirtieth yeer, it was the thirtieth yeer current, and ſo I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And whereas ſome would have it to be the thirtieth yeer of the <hi>

                           </gap>haldean</hi> account; it being according to them thirty yeers from the beginning of that Monarchy from <hi>Nebuchadonoſor,</hi> (as ſome call him) who was the father of this <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> the great, that carried away <hi>Iehoiachin</hi> into captivity: If it were the thirtieth yeer of that Monarchy, it falls in with the thirty yeers ſince the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> wherein the Law was found, and the Paſſeover kept; ſo that theſe two may ſtand together, and there need be no jarring between Interpreters for this time.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In the fourth moneth.</hi> It was not the Moneth <hi>Tebet</hi> or <hi>Thebeth</hi> (as ſome will have it) which anſwers to that we call <hi>Ianuary;</hi> but the moneth <hi>Tamuz,</hi> or <hi>Tammuz,</hi> that which anſwereth to part of <hi>Iune</hi> and part of <hi>Iuly;</hi> (about the time we are now in) for the <hi>Iewes</hi> were to reckon their moneths from <hi>April,</hi> as <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.2. <hi>This ſhall be the beginning of moneths, it ſhall be the firſt moneth of the yeer to you;</hi> that moneth was <hi>Abib, Niſan,</hi> or <hi>Niſſan,</hi> and anſwereth to part of <hi>March,</hi> and part of <hi>April;</hi> now from thence this is the fourth moneth, and falleth in with the latter end of <hi>Iune</hi> and beginning of <hi>Iuly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In the fifth day of the moneth.</hi> This I finde ſome do make to be the Sabbath day, and it is very probable that it ſhould be ſo; for <hi>Chapt.</hi> 3.16. hee ſaith, that <hi>at the end of ſeven dayes the Word of the Lord came unto</hi> him again. Hence they collect, that it is not likely
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:123227:24"/> that God would ſtep over the Sabbath day, and give <hi>Ezekiel</hi> viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon another day, and not upon that; for if <hi>Ezekiel</hi> had had his viſions upon another day, the people ſhould have been deſtitute of all the benefit, they were ſo imployed in their works of building and planting, and other accommodations for a captivity, that they had no leaſure to reſort unto <hi>Ezekiel</hi> upon a week day; therefore they ſtrongly conclude, that it was upon a Sabbath day, in the latter end of the week.</p>
                     <p>From hence obſerve:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That that time is not conſiderable wherein the Law of God is out of date; the time was reckoned here from the eighteenth yeere of <hi>Joſiah,</hi> wherein the Law was found. It was loſt in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſehs</hi> and <hi>Amons</hi> dayes, till the eighteenth yeere of <hi>Joſiah,</hi> when being found, it was brought forth for the comfort and inſtruction of the people, for the worſhip and honour of God, and from that <hi>punctum</hi> the Spirit of God reckons the time, and begins the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. When Gods Law is out of the way, and his Worſhip down, that is no conſiderable time at all in the eye of God. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that are in the dark, or dead, wee do not reckon of their time. One converted in his old age, ſaid, I have been long in the world, I have lived but a little time, meaning, ſince hee was converted, the time before was incomputable; The widow that liveth in pleaſure, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>is dead while ſhee lives,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.6.</note> and the world is dead that hath not the Law, the place is dead that hath not the Ordinances of God; ſo long they have been, but they have not lived, they have not meaſured time; and therefore the Spirit of God fixeth the account at the finding of the Law.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The things here not being ſpecified, but left undetermined, that God would have us obſerve the remarkable paſſages in Church and States when they fall out, not one or two, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, or all the chief: as the eighteenth yeer of <hi>Joſiah,</hi> when the Law was found, when that great paſſeover was kept, when he and the people of God entred into a ſolemn covenant with God, when the great reformation was made among them, ſuch great acts were taken notice of; as alſo the changes in <hi>Babylon,</hi> when the <hi>Chaldean</hi> Monarchy began, when <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was put into the Throne, and his head lifted up above others. God would have us take notice of the chief acts of his mercy and providence at
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:123227:25"/> chief times. <hi>Hoſea</hi> 14.8. <hi>Ephraim ſhall ſay, What have I to do any more with Idols?</hi> There will be a great alteration; then it will be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable time, ſaid God, <hi>I have heard him, and obſerved him,</hi> and then followeth, <hi>Who ſo is wiſe, and he ſhall undrſtand theſe things, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and he ſhall know them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now is a time of memorable emergents, and they ſhould be conſidered, the famous things of 1640. 1641. ought to be had in everlaſting remembrance: a triennall Parliament, reſurrection of Religion, Law and Goſpel were found again, Reformation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, Proteſtation and Covenants taken, the Kingdomes united here, and forain ones ſhaken in pieces.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 This makes for the truth and ſtrength of our Prophets viſions and prophecy; for when exact particular times and places are ſet down, that things were done in ſuch a yeer of ſuch a King, ſuch a moneth, ſuch a day of the moneth, it addes weight to an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Hiſtory; and when the Spirit of God ſhall ſo punctually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the time to a yeer, a moneth, a day, it is a ſtrong ſeal to the truth of the viſions and prophecy.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. See here <hi>(from the fifth day,)</hi> that God hath a ſpeciall care of his Sabbaths, and of the ſpirituall good of his ſervants. Of his Sabbaths, that they ſhall not lie in the dark, when they are in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> God will open heaven and appeare to a Prophet, and give him viſions upon a Sabbath day. God will do it too upon a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, that ſo the people which were in a ſad condition, that laboured now in Brick and Clay again, that were building, plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, taken up with ſecular affaires, might have a ſeaſonable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity for the good of their ſouls. The Sabbath was made for man, for the good of man, and they found it ſo. Though they be in <hi>Babylon,</hi> they ſhall have a Prophet, they ſhall have viſions, and viſions upon a Sabbath day, when they have liberty and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to come to the Prophet to be inſtructed in theſe viſions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudice to their Callings.</p>

                     <p n="2">2.

That the godly are wrapped up in the ſame calamity with the wicked. <hi>Ezekiel</hi> is among the captives, and many others with him; they loſt their countrey, friends, eſtates, liberties, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, they were in great miſery, brought very low, under a heathen King, amongſt enemies, expoſed to the ſcorns and wrongs of all, and <hi>Ezekiel, Daniel, the three Children, Mordecai,</hi> and many others, were all in the ſame condition. The children of God are ſubject to the ſame outward publike or private calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that the wicked are. <hi>All things come alike unto all;</hi> if you look upon the outward face of things, there is no exception. Good <hi>Joſiah</hi> was ſlain in the battell as well as wicked <hi>Ahab; Naboth</hi> was ſtoned as well as <hi>Achan:</hi> If <hi>David,</hi> a man after Gods own heart, proſper in the wars, ſo doth <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> a heathen, a tyrant: ſickneſſes, diſeaſes, deaths, of what kinde ſoever, are common to good as well as to bad: the ſword, plague, famine, hath ſeiſed upon the carkaſſes of the godly as well as the wicked: If wicked women die in child-birth, ſo doth good <hi>Rachel.</hi> There is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition but may befall the children of God;<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5.10.</note> the ſame afflictions are accompliſhed in your brethren, that are in the world; and no temptation hath taken hold of you, but ſuch as is common to the nature of man.

                        <pb n="34" facs="tcp:123227:28"/>5. That the godly are mingled in this world with the wicked and prophane; men of great worth, great grace, rare excellencies, they are not ſo priviledged as to be exempted from the ſociety of the wicked and ungodly. Here is <hi>Ezekiel</hi> amongſt the <hi>Chaldeans, Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> was amongſt the <hi>Egyptians:</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> ſaith of himſelf, <hi>Chap.</hi> 30.29. <hi>that he was a brother to Dragons, and a companion to Owles;</hi> and <hi>David</hi> cryes out, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 120.5. <hi>Wo is me that I ſojourne in Meſech and that I dwell in the tents of Kedar,</hi> that is, with a barbarous and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane people, that were like to the poſterity of <hi>Meſech,</hi> and <hi>Kedar;</hi> The Church of <hi>Smyrna, Rev.</hi> 2.9. was peſtred with the Synagogue of Satan, and <hi>Pergamus, verſ.</hi> 13. had her dwelling where Satans ſeat was. In that City, if you obſerve the 14. &amp; 15. verſes you ſhall finde there was much Idolatry and perſecution; for there were thoſe that held the Doctrine of <hi>Balaam,</hi> who <hi>taught Balac to caſt a ſtumbling block before the children of Iſrael, to eat things ſacrificed to Idols, and to commit fornication; and there Antipas my faithfull Martyr was ſlain.</hi> Where there is Idolatry will be perſecution and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe; and where theſe be is the ſeat of Satan, and the Church of <hi>Pergamos</hi> was ſeated even where Satan had his ſeat and throne; therefore it is no ſtrange thing for the people of God to dwell amongſt the wicked. In <hi>Canticles</hi> the Church of Chriſt is ſaid to be a Lilly among thornes; a Lilly, and none growing neer but thornes that ſcratch, prick, and tear the Church; <hi>Micah</hi> 7.4. <hi>The beſt of them is as a brier, the moſt upright is ſharper then a thorne hedge,</hi> the beſt of the wicked are Briers and Thornes one time or other. It is the lot of the godly to be among the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> while they live here in the world.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. See here that God hath a ſpeciall care of his Church and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when they are in the loweſt and worſt condition. Where now is <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> become? Where is the glory of all the world? now they are carried into captivity, now they are in a ſtrange land under a ſtrange King and government, now they are deprived of all their ſacrifices and ſervices of that nature; now they are impriſoned, now they are in danger of their liberties and lives every day; yet as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>Thou remembreſt us in our low eſtate,</hi> in this low eſtate, when they are at the river <hi>Chebar,</hi> in the land of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> doth God remember them, and ſends an <hi>Ezekiel</hi> to them, and unto him even in <hi>Chaldea,</hi> in <hi>Babylon,</hi> were the heavens opened, and he ſaw
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:123227:28"/> viſions of God. Where there are the greateſt enemies, God will ſhew himſelf a friend; where the Church is exceedingly ſtraitned, God will give enlargement; Now his people are in <hi>Babylon</hi> in cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, he ſends a Prophet to them, <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> the ſtrength of God, ſuch a Prophet as ſhall be ſtrong to keep them off from Idolatry, though they were amongſt Idolaters, ſtrong to comfort their hearts againſt all the ſtrong diſcouragements they had, ſtrong to lead them toward God and heaven, though they had falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets to lead them down to hell; ſtrong to oppoſe the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, to reprove them ſtoutly, to incourage the people faithfully, and to make known the mind of God unto them without flattery. They ſhall have a Prophet, though they be in <hi>Babylon;</hi> this ſhould ſtay up the ſpirits of the godly, if they ſhould be driven into Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſes, God will provide <hi>Ezekiels</hi> for them.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Obſerve from the place; that we are to take heed of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the condition of men by their outward afflictions. When great calamities come, people ordinarily grow great cenſurers, and condemn thoſe parties that are under them, to be the greateſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of all others. Take heed of this; If you will draw ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions as theſe, the hand of God is upon ſuch; in ſuch a place there is the plague, there is the ſword cutting them off, they are carried out of their countrey into captivity, there they are impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, there they are held in great bondage; ſurely theſe are none of Gods people, theſe are naught, vile perſons, reprobates; If you will judge thus, you will condemn the generation of the righteous: For <hi>Ezekiel, Daniel, Mordecai,</hi> the three <hi>Children,</hi> and many others very godly, were in the captivity, as well as thoſe that were very wicked; ſuch concluſions muſt not be drawn from the ſufferings of the Saints; you know the Prophets and Apoſtles met with very hard meaſure, while they were in the world, they were whipped, ſtocked, impriſoned, ſtoned, ſawn aſunder, tempted, tormented, ſlain with the ſword, and evill intreated every where; and if you ſhould meaſure their condition by their afflictions, condemnation muſt be their portion, and they muſt be in the catalogue of delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents. Have not ſome in our dayes, been ſlayed, roaſted alive, cut in pieces, thrown into the river? have not their houſes, and many in them been burnt together in <hi>Ireland?</hi> Have there not been cruell and deſperate things done? <hi>Ireland</hi> now is full of blood,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:123227:29"/> ſculs and graves; ſhall we ſay they are the greateſt ſinners that have ſuffered ſuch great things? When <hi>Pilate</hi> had mingled the blood of ſome of the <hi>Galileans</hi> with their ſacrifices, there were thoſe that preſently thought them greater ſinners then the reſt: but Chriſt hath taught them and us, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. what uſe to make of judgements upon others, not to cenſure them, but to repent our ſelves; <hi>Except you repent, you ſhall all likewiſe periſh;</hi> think not that they are greater ſinners then others, think not now that the <hi>Jewes</hi> in <hi>Babylon</hi> are greater ſinners then all others, think not thoſe in <hi>Ireland</hi> are greater ſinners then your ſelves. If hee be a wicked man that meets with great afflictions, then Chriſt muſt be the wickedeſt man that ever was; for he was <hi>vir doloris,</hi> a man of ſorrows, and had the greateſt affliction that ever befell any. As it was no argument of <hi>Zedekiah</hi> his goodneſſe, who at this time was in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> drank wine in bowles, and had a great deal of felicity; ſo it was no argument of <hi>Ezekiels</hi> guiltineſſe and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe that he was in a ſtrange land, in <hi>Chaldea,</hi> among the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, by the river <hi>Chebar. Paul,</hi> when he was at the barre, with Iron fetters about his heels, was a better man then <hi>Agrippa</hi> with his Crown on his head, and his Scepter in his hand, and ſitting in judgement to condemn him.<note place="margin">Dan. 9.</note>

                     <p>Touching <hi>Jehojachin,</hi> there are many things remarkeable.</p>
                     <p>As,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.9. it is ſaid, that <hi>he was eight yeares old when he began to reigne;</hi> and in 2 <hi>King.</hi> 24.8. it is ſaid, <hi>he was eighteene yeares old when he began to reigne.</hi> Here ſeems to be a great difference in the Scripture, hardly to be reconciled, and it hath puzled many.</p>
                     <p>This difference is thus reconciled: The Kings of <hi>Iudah</hi> when they were in imminent danger, did uſe to declare their ſonnes to be their ſucceſſors, and ſo <hi>Iehojakim</hi> the father of this <hi>Iehojachin</hi> being beſet by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> about the ſecond or third yeare of his reigne, did declare his ſonne <hi>Iehojachin</hi> to be his ſucceſſor; Now in the book of <hi>Chronicles</hi> he ſpeaks of the time from the firſt declaration which was about the eight yeare of <hi>Iehojachins</hi> age, and the booke of the <hi>Kings</hi> mentions the time when he came to reigne alone, and reckons from thence: For <hi>Iehojakim</hi> reigned di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers yeares after his ſonne was declared to be King, and reigned with his Father. So that the one book ſpeaks of the time he reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with his Father, the other of the time that he reigned alone in the Throne.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is remarkable touching <hi>Iehojachin</hi> that he had other names; As 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3.16. he is called <hi>Ieconiah,</hi> and <hi>Ier.</hi> 22.24. in diſgrace <hi>Coniah.</hi> He was a wicked King, and God cut off the firſt part of his name, a ſad preſage that ere long he would cut him off. Evill Kings who have had Gods name joyned with theirs, when they have rent themſelves from Gods commands and worſhip, he hath cut off his name from theirs, and taken mercy and peace from them. This you ſhall ſee in <hi>Eliakim,</hi> he was a wicked King; and in 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3.15. he is called <hi>Ioakim; El,</hi> that ſignifieth <hi>God,</hi> and was joyned to his name, is taken away. God would not ſuffer his
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:123227:30"/> name to be joyned with the name of ſo wicked a King any longer. So here in <hi>Ieconiah, Iah,</hi> which is one of the names of God, is taken away, and in hatred and contempt he is called <hi>Coniah:</hi> God was taken from his name, and departed from him too. When God will honour a man, he addes letters of his owne name to theirs; As <hi>Abram</hi> afterward was called <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">ה</note> a letter out of Gods name was put into his;<note place="margin">Gen. 32.28.</note> and ſo <hi>Iacob,</hi> his name was changed to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> a Prince of God, or one that prevails like a Prince with God.</p>
                     <p>When God changeth names in mercy, and makes an addition of letters of his own name unto mens,<note place="margin">Magnae bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volentiae pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus.</note> it is an argument of Gods great love, of great eſteeme and great honour to the partie; but it is an argument of diſgrace, when God either brands them, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts from their names. Thus God branded <hi>Ieroboam, Ieroboam the ſonne of Nebat that made Iſrael to ſinne,</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> the Traytor. And ſometime he detracts from their names, as here <hi>Ieconiah</hi> is called <hi>Coniah;</hi> the beginning and glory of his name is taken away; and he was (as <hi>Coniah</hi> ſignifieth) prepared of God, prepared of God for vengeance, prepared of God for a captivitie, for baſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, prepared of God to be a broken Idoll, to be caſt out and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed, as it is in that 22. of <hi>Ieremy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. This <hi>Iehojachin</hi> was written childleſſe, <hi>Ier.</hi> 22.30. <hi>Write this man childleſſe.</hi> A heavy doome to write a man childleſſe, eſpecially, a noble, a royall family, when children are much deſired by all, moſt by Princes, that ſo the Crown may not be alienated. <hi>Ieconiah</hi> is not written childleſſe in regard he had not any child; for <hi>ver.</hi> 28. it is ſaid, <hi>Wherefore have they caſt out him and his ſeed?</hi> He had ſeed, and yet was written childleſſe. How is that? He was as one that had no ſeed, he was deprived of the benefit and comfort of his ſeed; in effect he was a childleſſe man, becauſe his children were carried into captivitie, and none of them did inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and ſucceed him in the Throne; for it is ſaid, <hi>ver.</hi> 30. <hi>No man of his ſeed ſhall proſper, ſitting upon the throne of David, and ruling any more in Iudah;</hi> they dyed in captivitie, and none of them did ſway the Scepter of that Kingdome.</p>
                     <p>But there is ſome objection lying againſt this; For in 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Salathiel</hi> is ſaid to be his ſonne, and his ſonne begotten in captivitie, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.12. If <hi>Salathiel</hi> be his ſonne, and his ſonne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten in captivitie, how then is this true that he was written childleſſe?</p>
                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:123227:30"/>
                     <p>You muſt know (for anſwer) that this in the 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> and <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. is ſpoken after the legall account; for <hi>Jeconiah,</hi> or <hi>Jehoja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin,</hi> having been 37. yeares in captivitie (as you ſhall read after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward) he had ſeene the death of his ſonnes and daughters, his unckles and kindred, ſo that he had none left of his own loynes, or any that were very neare unto him, to declare to be his ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor and to inherit the Crowne, therefore having neither ſonne, brother, unckle, nor kindred that were neare unto him, he was as a man childleſſe every way. Now <hi>Salathiel</hi> being his neareſt kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man alive, he declareth him to be heire to the Crowne, and to ſucceed him in the royall dignitie, according to the order ſet downe by God in caſe of the want of iſſue, <hi>Numb.</hi> 27.8, 9. &amp;c. And now this kinſman in the legall ſenſe is ſaid to be the ſonne of <hi>Jehojachin,</hi> that is, the ſucceſſor of <hi>Jehojachin;</hi> not that he was his naturall ſonne come out of his loynes, for <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.27. <hi>Salathiel</hi> was the ſonne of <hi>Neri,</hi> according to the naturall line. Be it then according to the legall account, that <hi>Jehojachin</hi> was his father, yet ſtill it holds good, <hi>Iehojachin</hi> was a man childleſſe.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. In this King was ended the glory and royall dignitie of the houſe of <hi>David.</hi> It is true that <hi>Zedekiah</hi> reigned ſome yeares after him, but <hi>Zedekiah</hi> dyed before <hi>Iehojachin:</hi> and in the genealogie of Chriſt, <hi>Iehojachin</hi> is mentioned, not <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> neither is there men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any more Kings of <hi>Iudah</hi> after him; he was the period of the booke of the <hi>Kings,</hi> and he finiſhed the line of the houſe of <hi>David.</hi> None out of his loynes, nor out of any other loynes did ſit upon the Throne till Chriſt came. As for <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> who was thought to be King, and to ſit upon the Throne after the captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, it will appeare he was no King; for the learned obſerve that he was rather a Captain, Duke, or Leader of the people, and was ſtirred up of God to further and finiſh the worke of the Temple, after which (the Rabbins ſay) <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> returned into <hi>Babylon</hi> and there dyed.</p>
                     <p>But if that be not ſufficient to cleare it that he was no King, you may obſerve in <hi>Zach.</hi> 6.11. that when two Crownes were made, neither of them was ſet upon the head of <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> but both were ſet upon the head of <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Ioſedech</hi> the high Prieſt; ſhewing that all the power was inveſted in the high Prieſt, and tranſlated from Regall to Pontificall. So that <hi>Iehoja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin</hi>
                        <pb n="40" facs="tcp:123227:31"/> was an unproſperous man, to lay the glory of the houſe of <hi>David</hi> and of his owne in the duſt: And hence that name is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived likewiſe to be given him,<note place="margin">

                     <p n="5">5. His captivitie was long and ſore, 37. yeares was he a priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in <hi>Babylon,</hi> as appeares 2 <hi>King.</hi> 25.27. Others had there more libertie, they were not impriſoned, they had the benefit of the Prophets, advantage of all the Ordinances which were amongſt them, thoſe they had to ſweeten their captivitie, with many outward comforts, whereas <hi>Jehojachin</hi> lay in priſon, and was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of them; his Crowne, Throne, Scepter, Kingdome, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, all were gone, and he is a captive impriſoned.

                     <p>From all this obſerve:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The different proceeding of God with Kings that are good, and Kings that are evill. Good Kings, as <hi>David, Hezekiah, Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaphat, Ioſiah,</hi> how precious are their names! how ſweet are they! like an oyntment powred out: how doe they keepe up the glory of their houſes! they are not written childleſſe, they are not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten men that ſhall not proſper; God doth not brand them with any note of infamy, nor detract from their names, they are not carried into captivitie. But for Kings that are wicked, how doth the Lord proceed in his anger againſt them, and make their names to rot! See it in <hi>Ahaz,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.22. God ſets an Emphaſis, a ſtarre upon him, brands him with a note of diſgrace for all men to obſerve that reade his Story, <hi>This is that King Ahaz;</hi> What King was he? Even that King that in the <hi>time of his diſtreſſe did treſpaſſe yet more againſt the Lord;</hi> that King that ruined himſelfe and all <hi>Iſrael</hi> with him, that King that ſhooke the foundation of Church and State; <hi>This is that King Ahaz.</hi> So <hi>Jeroboam</hi> is branded, he is ſeldome or never mentioned but this is added to his name, <hi>he made Iſrael to ſinne.</hi> So <hi>Eliakim</hi> a wicked King had part of his name taken away; and here this <hi>Jehojachin</hi> is called <hi>Ieconiah</hi> and <hi>Coniah,</hi> a broken Idoll, a veſſell in which there is no pleaſure, a man that muſt be written childleſſe, a man that muſt be carried into captivitie, and be impriſoned 37. yeares. Good Kings are the glory of the world, the glory of that State where they live: but theſe evill Kings in <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> their memory ſtinkes, their names rot, their poſteritie is cut off, their houſes fall to the duſt, and they have a foundation of wrath for their iſſue, if they have
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:123227:32"/> any; foure times within the compaſſe of 23. years, were they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into captivitie. God proceedeth againſt wicked Kings to the third and fourth generation, for their Idolatry and oppreſſion, for the evills they countenance and maintaine in their Kingdoms, and in his worſhip.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That afflictions are invalid to ſubdue corruptions. Five yeares they had been now in captivitie, and yet their corruptions were not mortified, all the hard things they had met withall, had not made them yeeld and ſtoope to God. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> had been Gods Hammer to batter them in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> in <hi>Sion,</hi> and God had exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed them five yeares with his wrath in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and yet their iron adamantine hearts were not broken, but <hi>Ezekiel</hi> muſt be ſtirred up now in the fifth yeare of <hi>Jehojachins</hi> captivitie, a Prophet that muſt be the ſtrength of God to breake them, that muſt lay on load and not ſpare. You ſee then that afflictions of themſelves doe not kill corruptions, they doe not breake the principle of ſtubbornneſſe, and ſtrength of rebellion that is in the hearts of men and women. Nay,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 28.22.</note> ſometimes it proveth ſo, that afflictions make us the worſe, like waters being reſtrained they ſwell higher and threaten heaven it ſelfe, ſo corruptions being reſtrained, they ſwell and threaten the ruine of States, Families, of ſoules and bodies to all eternitie: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Why ſhould yee be ſtricken any more? yee will revolt more and more.</hi> Let God come with a plague to a Citie, with a ſword to a ſinfull Nation, let God come with any judgement, the judgements themſelves will never doe us good, unleſſe there be ſomething ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the judgements, unleſſe they be ſanctified to us; our proud ſtubborne hearts, our vile natures will ſtand it out againſt God, even when the ſword is in his hand.</p>

Then was <hi>Daniel, Mordecai,</hi> the three Children likewiſe, and <hi>Ezekiel</hi> carried into captivitie, as ſundry affirme. And that he was then carried into captivitie, is evident from the Text it ſelfe, for in the 40. Chapter of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie, ver. 1. it is ſaid, <hi>In the</hi> 25. <hi>yeare of our captivitie;</hi> he joyneth himſelfe, and doth not ſay <hi>their,</hi> but <hi>our captivitie;</hi> and therefore was then brought into <hi>Babylon</hi> when <hi>Ieconiah</hi> was, and from that time began the captivitie, and the reckoning of the 70. yeares. Now he began to prophecy in the fifth yeare of the captivitie, thirty-foure yeares after <hi>Ieremy,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Jere. 1.2.</note> who began in the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> yeare of <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> and had prophecied long, but done little good amongſt them, they were ſo obſtinate in his dayes; God ſtirreth up <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and ſets him aworke, and he prophecieth 22. yeares, as wee may gather out of his owne prophecy, Chap. 29.17. <hi>In the</hi> 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                        <hi>yeare the Word of the Lord came unto me:</hi> It was five years before he began to prophecy, and 22. years after wee heare of his prophecying. He might prophecy longer, but we finde it not recorded in holy Writ.</p>
                     <p>If it be demanded, What became of this Prophet <hi>Ezekiel?</hi> Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie tels us that his end was very lamentable, and yet like a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; for uſually the Prophets came to untimely deaths. <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chomius</hi> ſaith, he was torne in pieces with horſes.<note place="margin">Lib. de incarn. Verbi.</note> 
                        <hi>Athanaſius</hi> tells us, he was killed for the peoples ſake. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> relates that he was ſlaine by the Ruler of the people for reproving his Idolatry. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> in his 46. <hi>Homilie</hi> upon <hi>Matthew</hi> 23. and thoſe words, <hi>O Ieruſalem, thou that ſlayeſt the Prophets, &amp;c.</hi> ſaith thus; O <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> I have ſent to thee <hi>Iſaiah</hi> the Prophet, and thou haſt ſawen him aſunder; I have ſent thee <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> and thou haſt ſtoned him to death; I have ſent to thee <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and by dragging him amongſt the ſtones, thou haſt daſhed out his brains. All agree in this, that <hi>Ezekiel</hi> came to an untimely and bloudy end; and ſo did moſt of the Prophets and Apoſtles. What ever mens ends were in kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Prophets, God had other ends; That by their bloud and death, the doctrine they delivered, being ſealed, might paſſe the better; That none ſhould look for great matters here in this world, when ſuch great Worthies were ſo ill intreated; That men might be ſtirred up by their example, to ſtand for the truth unto the death; That it might be a demonſtration of the judgement to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:123227:33"/> come; ſeeing they were uſed ſo hardly here, ſurely it follows then that there is a time wherein God will call over things againe, and recompence the ſufferings of his Prophets, and be avenged on thoſe that had done them ſuch wrong. God had ſuch ends as theſe.</p>
                     <p>Hence note;</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The wiſdome of God, that touching the lives and deaths of the Prophets and Apoſtles ſpeaks little. There is not much ſaid in the Scripture touching them; and why? Leſt we ſhould attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute too much to them, and too little to God. Wee are apt to looke at the pen rather then at him that made the pen, put in the inke, and writes with it. We looke at the inſtrument, and neglect the principall agent. Since the lives and deaths of Martyrs and holy men came into requeſt, God hath loſt too much of that honour hath been due unto him; creatures have had it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. See here the ingratitude of the people, that doe not onely kick, but kil their Prophets, not only mock, but murther their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> is ſawen aſunder, <hi>Ieremy</hi> ſtoned, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> his brains are daſhed out; Oh the ingratitude of the ſonnes of men, that doe thus requite God for the Prophets he ſends to them, that breake the earthen veſſels for bringing them heavenly treaſures in them!</p>

                     <p>The Prieſthood, you know, was intailed upon the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> and it is very obſervable what was the occaſion of it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. When the people had ſinned in Idolatry, and grew ſeditious and tumultuous, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtood in the gate of the Camp, and ſaid, <hi>Who is on the Lords ſide? Let him come unto mee.</hi> Whereupon <hi>all the ſons of Levi gathered themſelves together unto him, with their ſwords by their ſides,</hi> and preſently executed the commands and counſell of <hi>Moſes, and ſlew every man his brother, companion, neighbour,</hi> v. 27. They were one of the leaſt, if not the very leaſt Tribe of all the twelve, yet were they not fearfull, or backward unto this work, but ventured themſelves among the people, ſhewing great faith and zeal to vindicate Religion, and the glory of God. This fact and forwardneſſe of theirs was ſo well taken of God, that it brought a choyce bleſſing upon them and theirs, God fully rewarded them for it: for whereas a curſe was threatened againſt <hi>Levi,</hi> Gen. 49.7. <hi>I will divide them in Jacob, and ſcatter them in Iſrael,</hi> yet this curſe was turned into a bleſſing, and they are exalted to be neer the Lord in the holy things of the Temple that did appertain to his worſhip and ſervice; for after they had finiſhed that execution up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the people, the Text ſaith, <hi>verſe</hi> 29. That <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid to them, <hi>Conſecrate your ſelves to day to the Lord, becauſe every man hath been againſt his ſon, and againſt his brother, that the Lord may beſtow upon you a bleſſing this day;</hi> and thereupon they were taken into the place of the firſt-born (that did all before) and had the Prieſthood ſetled upon their Tribe, together with a choice bleſſing, which is recorded, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.8. 9, 10. <hi>And of Levi he ſaid, Let thy Thummim and thy Vrim be with thy holy one; Bleſſe Lord, his ſubſtance, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the work of his hands, ſmite through the loynes of them that riſe againſt him, and of them that hate him, that they riſe not again.</hi> Here was the occaſion of <hi>Levies</hi> being taken into the Prieſthood, and to ſerve with God, and to ſerve for ever.</p>
                     <p>From hence take this note which is very conſiderable: That it is good to appeare in the cauſe of God, and to be forward to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate his honour and glory, to ſtand for him and his people: It is good to vindicate God when he ſuffereth in his worſhip, in his

You ſhall finde in <hi>Iudges</hi> 5.18. That <hi>Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives unto the death in the high places of the field;</hi> They went forth, and ſtood for God and his people againſt <hi>Iabin</hi> and <hi>Siſera,</hi> that came againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and threatened ruine: And in <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.13.14, 15. when Chriſt cometh, hee preacheth the Goſpel firſt to them; God remembreth their kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and rewardeth it, though it were long before: So you may lay the foundation of a mercy for your poſterities a hundred yeers hence.

                     <p>The word <hi>opening,</hi> among the <hi>Jewes,</hi> notes ſometime, not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, but the effect of a thing. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.7. <hi>Their eyes were opened;</hi> they were not ſhut before, but now they ſaw that which they ſaw not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:123227:35"/> and ſo their eyes are ſaid to be opened. In the Goſpel Chriſt is ſaid to open the eyes of the blind, the ears and mouth of the deaf and dumb, not that their mouths were abſolutely ſhut, or their ears abſolutely ſtopped, or their eyes ſo cloſed that they could not ſtir their eye-lids, but Chriſt opened them ſo, as hee made them to ſee, heare and ſpeak, to do that which they could not do before; ſo that in regard of the effect they are ſaid to be opened. Sometimes again it noteth the truth of a thing; and ſo <hi>Stephen</hi> ſaw heaven opened, and Chriſt ſtanding at the right hand of God; and <hi>Peter</hi> ſaw heaven opened, and a ſheet coming down to him.</p>
                     <p>The queſtion is, whether of theſe wayes it is to be taken here? <hi>Origen</hi> ſaith, That the heavens were open to the eyes of his body, there was a diviſion of the heavens, and ſo in a literall ſenſe he ſaw the viſions, and the things preſented to him; But <hi>Jerome</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Non diviſione firmamenti, ſed fide credentis.</note> The heavens were opened, not by the rending of the firmament, but by the faith of the believer. You may take it in the literall ſenſe, and according to the truth of a thing. The inconvenience objected againſt it is not conſiderable: for, it is ſaid, If the heavens were literally opened, how could <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſee ſo far, as to ſee things in heaven? the ſtrength of his eyes could not reach it; for if the Sun and fixed Stars which are far above the Sun, are greater bodies then the earth, and ſeem ſo little unto us, how little would any thing in heaven ſeem to the eye, when it is exceedingly beyond both theſe?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The heavens being opened, it doth not follow that <hi>Ezekiel</hi> muſt ſee the viſions in heaven, the things he ſaw might be neerer then the Stars or Sun. The Dove came down and lighted upon Chriſt, and the ſheet was let down from heaven unto <hi>Peter,</hi> and ſo the viſions might be neerer unto <hi>Ezekiel</hi> then the higheſt heavens; <hi>The heavens were opened, and he ſaw viſions of God.</hi> it is not ſaid that he ſaw viſions in heaven; and grant it to be in heaven, <hi>Stephen</hi> ſaw Chriſt there, and ſo might <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſee the object of his viſion there: yet neither did <hi>Stephen</hi> by his naturall ſtrength ſee Chriſt, nor <hi>Ezekiel</hi> theſe viſions, but he that opened heaven did open their eyes, ſtrengthened them to ſee at ſuch a diſtance: Or, Secondly, you may take it effectively, that was done to the eye of faith, as if heaven had been opened. A thing is ſaid to be opened when that is removed which hinders coming at the thing
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:123227:36"/> ſhut up, <hi>the ſeven ſeals were looſed,</hi> Rev. 5. then was the book ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, when the ſhuts of the window are turned aſide, that the eye can come at the light, then the window is open, the impediments are taken away:<note place="margin">Vbi diſcuſsis omnibus obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culis Deus fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit ut fidelium oculi uſque ad gloriam ipſius coeleſtem pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trent.</note> and heaven is open, when all lets being ſet aſide, God cauſeth the eyes of his to ſee divine viſions, or reveals divine myſteries unto them, as if heaven were open; and this is the way moſt peculiar to the ſervants of God. <hi>Hereafter</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>You ſhall ſee Heaven opened, and the Angels aſcending and deſcending upon the Son of man.</hi> The Angels are not corporeall, they cleave not the heavens aſunder in their deſcent, or aſcent, that is not the meaning, but the ſpirit of the Text is this; the impediments ſhould be taken away from their minds, they ſhould be ſo enlightened with the glory of the Goſpel, they ſhould ſee, as it were, even An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels come down and miniſter unto Chriſt; they ſhould, as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is,<note place="margin">Nova acie, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertis oculis.</note> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. <hi>with open face behold as in a glaſſe the glory of God,</hi> ſee heaven opened in Chriſt, and the Angels deſcending upon the Son of man; And ſo did <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſee heaven opened.</p>

If you would have mercies, you muſt look up to God for them, and deſire him to turn the key. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.7. he is ſaid to <hi>have the key of David, he opens and none can ſhut, he ſhuts and none can open;</hi> a key notes power, and the key of <hi>David</hi> chief power in the houſe, in the Kingdome; where that key is, there is the greateſt power; God hath that key in his hand, the key of <hi>David,</hi> all power to open and ſhut heaven when he will, he can open your hearts at his pleaſure, he can open Texts at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, he can open dark things unto you; therefore ſeeing all power is in the hand of God; look up to him for mercies, and deſire him to turn the key for your good and his glory.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>That God doth great things for thoſe that are truly godly, that are true beleevers. Heaven is opened for them, and onely for them.</hi>

                     <p>Wee doe not reade in the booke of God, that heaven was

And it is opened to <hi>Ezekiel</hi> here in the Text, <hi>I ſaw hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven opened.</hi> It is ſhut againſt others, wicked men ſhall never ſee it open in mercie; the Judgement at laſt ſhall not be in heaven, but in the aire, or on the earth. It is the priviledge of beleevers to have choice mercies.</p>
                     <p>Great things God will doe for them that the world ſhall have no ſhare in. It was the godly that ſaw Chriſt after the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not any wicked man.

It is for the heirs of ſalvation that the Angels are ſent forth to be miniſtring Spirits unto, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. And it is for the faithfull the heavens are opened, that they may ſee what the glory of their Fathers houſe is, into what a familie they ſhall ere long be received. This ſets out the excellency of faith unto us; for as it is a hand to receive Chriſt and his benefits, a mouth to eate his fleſh, and drinke his bloud; ſo it is an eye to ſee into heaven, and the eye for which heaven is opened.</p>

                     <p>In a Viſion there are theſe things:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. There is ſome ſpecies or ſimilitude repreſented to the ſight, whether it be to the eye of the body externally, or to the eye of the minde internally, alwayes ſomething is repreſented to the eye.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A Viſion is of ſomething that is future, whether at ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle diſtance, or very remote. Hence it is that Viſion is put for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.1.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. In a Viſion there is alwayes ſuch an irradiation of the mind, ſuch divine, ſatisfying, over-powering, ſtrong light, that the partie who hath the Viſion is put out of all doubt and diſpute concerning the truth of the thing he hath ſeene, or is repreſented.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Moller.</hi> Pſ. 89.20.</note>4. There is in a viſion a ſtrong impulſe upon the ſpirit of the partie to doe that which is the minde of God concerning that viſion.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. It is when they are awake. God ſpeaks to men by dreames in the darke when they are aſleepe, but uſually viſions are when men are awake.</p>
                     <p>All theſe are found here in the Prophet <hi>Ezekiels</hi> viſion:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. There are repreſentations of diverſe things to him, he was
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:123227:37"/> an Hieroglyphicall Prophet, he had more things preſented unto him of that nature then any Prophet beſides; All that followeth here in this Chapter, are repreſentations of things to <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in this viſion.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is of things to come; for this Prophecie being either of the ruine of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or of the ſtate of the Church, ſtill it was of that which was not preſent but future.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Prophet he had ſtrong inlightnings, he had ſuch irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diations of his minde that he was ſatisfied touching the thing, therefore he ſaith, <hi>The word of the Lord came expreſly unto him,</hi> the hand of the Lord came upon him in a great deale of ſtrength.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. He had a mightie impulſe, though he was backward, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to goe on in the worke of God, yet the Spirit came upon him with power, and put him on.</p>
                     <p>And laſtly, it was when he was awake, walking up and down by the river <hi>Chebar,</hi> there he had theſe viſions.</p>
                     <p>Thus much for the nature of a viſion; now theſe viſions were viſions of God. <hi>I ſaw viſions of God.</hi> Not that he ſaw God oft, and ſo every ſight of God made a new viſion, (for no man can ſee God and live) but viſions revealed to him by God, which did in ſome meaſure ſet out the glory and majeſtie of God; and ſo they are called viſions of God.</p>
                     <p>Or viſions of God by way of oppoſition and excluſion, thus; I ſaw viſions of God, I had divine viſions, not Satanicall deluſions; (for Satan hath his Prophets, and they have their viſions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they delude the world) not dreames and conceits of mine own, no Angel, no Devill, no dreame, no fancy of mine preſented them unto me, but they were propheticall viſions, ſuch as God himſelfe hath preſented.</p>
                     <p>Or viſions of God laſtly, in regard of the eminency of them. <hi>I ſaw viſions of God,</hi> that is, choice, rare, difficult, tranſcendent vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Things that excell, in Scripture-phraſe uſually are ſaid to be things of God; As the Mountains of God, the Cedars of God, the Citie of God; as you may reade <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80.10. <hi>Jonah</hi> 3.3.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Obſerve here the certaintie of the things contained in this Prophet. He doth not ſay, <hi>I heard,</hi> but <hi>I ſaw viſions of God.</hi> The ſenſe of ſight is the moſt certaine, moſt active, moſt diſcerning,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:123227:38"/> moſt evidentiall of all the ſenſes. Therefore 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.1.3. <hi>That which we have ſeene with our eyes, which we have looked upon, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare unto you.</hi> There was certaintie in that which they ſaw.

                        <hi>How much truth ſhould differ from a lie;</hi> his anſwer was, <hi>As much as the eyes differ from the eares:</hi> inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating, that what you heare may be falſe, but what you ſee that is certain. The Prophet here ſaw <hi>viſions of God,</hi> to ſhew the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of theſe viſions, and ſo of the whole Scriptures, which are <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. See here the dignitie of theſe Viſions, they are <hi>viſions of God,</hi> ſuch as are great, glorious, tranſcendent things. Mens words, works, things are meane, poore, and worthleſſe, but the things, the <hi>viſions of God,</hi> they are ſo high, ſo excellent, that few can reach them, they are beyond the apprehenſions of ordinary men: yea the Prophets themſelves did not ſee all that was in thoſe viſions, God did vouchſafe unto them. This ſhews the things of God have tranſcendency in them, are of great authoritie, and challenge an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable eſteem. Theſe are <hi>viſions of God,</hi> and muſt with all Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be valued accordingly. Hence the Ancients have called the Scriptures, <hi>An Epiſtle of God ſent from Heaven to the ſonnes of men.</hi> Therefore in them is nothing impertinent, empty, but all in them is glorious, full of ſenſe, myſteries, and Spirit; this ſtrengthens the authoritie of Scripture,<note place="margin">Ne titubet fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</note> that our faith may not ſtagger at all, but be confident, and build upon them, as viſions and truths of God.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. See here, that when God beginneth once to let out mercy to his ſervants, he ſtints not preſently, but proceeds, I ſaw not one viſion, but, <hi>I ſaw viſions of God,</hi> hee had many choice ones. It was kindneſſe that <hi>Ezekiel</hi> had ſuch a name, <hi>The ſtrength of God;</hi> it was kindneſſe that the Lord would open heaven to him; it had been great kindneſſe if he had ſeen but one viſion; but for <hi>Ezekiel</hi> to have heaven opened, and to ſee viſions of God, many viſions, one after another, this ſheweth the great kindneſſe of God. When <hi>Rachel</hi> had her firſt ſon, ſhe called his name <hi>Joſeph,</hi> which ſignifieth adding, or increaſe; for ſhe ſaid, <hi>The Lord ſhall adde to mee another ſon,</hi> Gen. 30.24. Now God hath begun to ſhew kindneſſe, he ſhall not only give me this, but he ſhall give me another ſon alſo.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:123227:38"/> When the Lord hath beſtowed one mercy on you, you may name it <hi>Joſeph,</hi> increaſe, addition, for God will beſtow another upon you. <hi>Abraham</hi> had many mercies from God, one after another; and <hi>Moſes</hi> a multitude of mercies, he converſeth with God face to face, he heareth God ſpeak, he hath Gods preſence to go along with him; yea, he ſeeth all Gods goodneſſe and glory to paſſe before him. When mercies come forth, God will not preſently ſhut the door of mercy again: Heaven is opened, viſions are preſented one after another. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.10. <hi>Continue thy loving kindneſſe,</hi> the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew is, <hi>draw forth,</hi> or, <hi>draw out thy loving kindneſſe:</hi> A metaphor either taken from veſſels of Wine, which being ſet abroach once, yeeld not only one cup, but many cups: ſo when God ſetteth abroach the Wine of his mercy, he will not fill your cup once, but twice and ſeven times: or, taken from a Mother, who hath her breaſts full of milk, drawes them out for her childe, not once, but often; the child ſhall have the breaſt many times in the day, and many times in the night: ſo when God beginneth to ſhew mercy to you, he will draw out his breaſts of conſolation, and will beſtow mercy after mercy upon you: or from a line which is extended; for ſo God being in a way of mercy, will extend the line of mercy, and meaſure out mercy after mercy for you. Is not heaven now opened? Do you not ſee viſions of God this day? How often is heaven opened in this City in a week? How many viſions have you from the Prophets? What manifeſtations of truths are there? What diſcoveries of the minde and will of God to your ſouls are there in theſe dayes? <hi>I ſaw viſions of God,</hi> ſaith <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and ſo may you.</p>

                        <hi>And the hand of the Lord was there upon mee.]</hi> The hand of the Lord is taken in two ſenſes, eſpecially in Scripture:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. For judgement, or puniſhment, ſo you have it, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.11. ſpeaking of <hi>Elymas</hi> the Sorcerer, ſaith <hi>Paul, The hand of the Lord ſhall be upon thee, and thou ſhalt be blind;</hi> Gods hand was upon <hi>Elymas,</hi> and he was ſtricken blind for perverting the Deputy. In this ſenſe it is not taken here.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The hand of the Lord is taken for prophecy: When the Lord doth come upon the ſons of men, and ſtirs up their ſpirits to prophecy, that is the hand of the Lord.</p>
                     <p>But yet this is not all: It noteth the vertue and power of the Spirit of God which came upon the Prophet; not ſhaking, diſturbing, and throwing of him down, as ſome Rabbies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, but changing, comforting, elevating and exciting the ſpirit of the Prophet to ſee divine myſteries; and notes alſo, that effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and power which did ſet on the Word upon the heart and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of the Prophet; that power which did ſubdue all oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, carnall reaſonings, and remove all impediments whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſtuck upon the heart of the Prophet, and hindred him in that work which God would have him to undertake; It is this hand of the Lord that makes the Word mighty, ſpirituall, live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, according to that in <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4.12. the Prophet felt the intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecall vertue of this hand, the Spirit of God in his own heart; it was a quick and lively word unto him. This intrinſecall vertue of the Spirit, if it reached not the Prophets hearers, yet it abode in the prophecy, and it remains an efficacious prophecy to this day. It's worth inquiſition, what the vertue of the Spirit is, expreſſed here by the hand of God.</p>
                     <p>There are three things in it: The hand is
<list>
                           <item>1. <hi>Symbolum roboris.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>2. <hi>Index veritatis.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>3. <hi>Inſtrumentum operationis.</hi>
                           </item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="57" facs="tcp:123227:39"/>1. The hand is <hi>Symbolum roboris,</hi> the Type or Embleme of ſtrength; therefore of a ſtrong man, we ſay he is a man of his hands, that is the ſymbol of his ſtrength: So the Spirit of God is a Spirit of ſtrength, the hand of God notes the ſtrength of God, and the Holy Ghoſt is the power and ſtrength of God. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.35. <hi>The Holy Ghoſt ſhall come upon thee, and the power of the Higheſt ſhall over-ſhadow thee: And greater is he that is in you then he that is in the world.</hi> The Spirit of God that is in the hearts of his children, he is of more ſtrength then <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> the prince of Devils, and god of this world.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The hand is <hi>Index veritatis,</hi> the hand or finger doth ſhew a thing; If you would have a man goe this way or that way, you ſhew him or point him with the finger, you direct him with your hand: <hi>Salomon, Prov.</hi> 6.13. ſpeaking of the wicked man, ſaith, <hi>He teacheth with his fingers,</hi> that is, he ſhewes others by his hand to do wickedly; the Spirit of God is <hi>Index veritatis,</hi> this hand of God doth ſhew you the truth, 1 <hi>John</hi> 16.13, 14. <hi>He ſhall ſhew you,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>things to come, He ſhall take of mine and ſhew it unto you;</hi> It is the Spirit of Chriſt, this hand of God that ſheweth you all things; you will never know truths till this hand point to them, and teach you: you may have notions in your head, and gueſſings in your ſpirits and boſomes, but the reality and certainty of things will never be attained to, till the ſpirit of God acquaint you with them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The hand is <hi>Inſtrumentum operationis,</hi> the inſtrument of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; men do all by the hand, therefore it is called the Organ of organs by the Philoſopher. So the Spirit of God that doth all, <hi>Zach.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit: I will do all by that, ſaith God:</hi> It is the Spirit of God that doth convince; it's the Spirit that doth convert; it's the Spirit that doth dictate and inſpire godly men; it's the Spirit that ſanctifies; it's the Spirit that leads into truth, that comforts; the Spirit is the great agent, the hand of God by which God doth all his works. It was the Spirit that moved upon the face of the waters at firſt; the Spirit of God was the agent in the work of creation, and the great agent in the work of redemption and ſalvation.</p>
                     <p>Theſe phraſes being thus opened, obſerve hence:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the Prophet received what he delivered to them from
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:123227:40"/> God; <hi>The hand of the Lord was there upon me, and the Word of the Lord came expreſsly.</hi> The Prophets muſt deliver to the people what they receive from God, and not what they bring of themſelves: They muſt not bring their own viſions, their own conceits, what ſeemeth good in their own eyes; but they muſt bring the Word of the Lord to the people; They muſt not ſpeak according to the humours of the people, as they move them, as they would have them, but they muſt ſpeak as the Spirit of God moves them, as God will have them: 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. <hi>The holy men ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.23.</note> and <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>What I have received of the Lord, that I deliver unto you;</hi> he would not deliver any thing he had from the world, or from himſelf, but, <hi>what I received from the Lord that I deliver unto you.</hi> Miniſters they are Gods <hi>Seeds-men,</hi> and they muſt have their ſeed from God, elſe they will ſow tares.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is of much concernment for Miniſters, to ſee they have a good and clear Call to their Miniſtery. <hi>Ezekiel</hi> here ſtands much upon it; <hi>I ſaw heaven opened, I ſaw viſions of God, and the Word of the Lord came expreſly to mee, and the hand of the Lord was there upon mee.</hi> Here were ſtrong evidences of his Call to the work he was to go about. Miniſters are to be the mouth of God to the people, and the mouth of the people to God, both are weighty buſineſſes; they deal about the eternall truths of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall God, your immortall ſouls, and the everlaſting condition of them. The glory of God is concredited in a great meaſure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; the great things of the Kingdome of Chriſt are put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hands, to diſpenſe as God ſhall move, and give them op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity. Had they not need therefore to ſee to it, that their Call be right, and to make it out ſtrongly and clearly, that God hath ſent them? If they can clear it up that God hath ſent them, they may expect his aſſiſtance, his bleſſing, his protection and ſucceſſe in their labours. How ever things prove, this will be their comfort in the midſt of oppoſition, reproach, perſecution, hazard of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and lives, I was called of God, I am in his work, in his way, he brought me into his Vineyard, hee will ſtand by mee, I will go on, let him do with me what he pleaſeth. The clearneſſe of a mans Call will add much comfort to a mans ſpirit in a black day; it makes conſcientious, pitifull and painfull; a Miniſters call being evident, the peoples conſciences will be ſatisfied, will receive his
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:123227:40"/> doctrine; then will they look upon him as their Paſtor and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, reverence him for his works ſake, and are likely to receive much good by him: Whereas otherwiſe, if the Calling of Miniſters reach no higher then a Patron or Prelate, there is ſeldome any good comes either to Miniſters or people; therefore it concernes them to look narrowly to it, that their Calling be of God, cleare and ſtrong to themſelves, elſe they cannot make it out to others; neither ſhall finde that comfort, nor do that good which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they might.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That in corrupt times, when Religion, the Chu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ch, and Gods glory are greatly indangered, God then takes care to raiſe up ſome extraordinary ſervants to vindicate his truth, in his people, his glory; all was brought now to a deſolate condition, falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets prevailed, Religion ſuffered, Gods honour was low, and now God takes <hi>Ezekiel</hi> that was one of the ordinary Prieſts before, and beſtowes a larger meaſure of his Spirit upon him, and raiſeth him up to be a Prophet, and ſets him awork, to do great things in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon.</hi> Though now men be not called immediatly by the voyce of God and Chriſt, as of old, yet by extraordinary inſtincts and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Gods Spirit, they were heretofore, and are ſtill put upon great ſervices: <hi>Philip</hi> was a Deacon by his ordinay Calling, but by extraordinary inſtinct and hints of Gods Spirit, he was raiſed up to be an Evangeliſt, and to do greater ſervice unto the Church of God. So <hi>Luther,</hi> that was a Frier at firſt, by extraordinary inſtinct of Gods Spirit, was raiſed up to purge errors out of the Church, and to glorifie God, eſpecially in clearing the doctrine of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Free grace: So <hi>Zwinglius, Wickliffe,</hi> and others in our dayes; God hath not left himſelf without witneſſe at this day, he hath ſtirred up the ſpirits of ſome to do him great and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary ſervices.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That thoſe Miniſters are fitteſt to ſpeak to the people, that finde the Word of God to have being in them. <hi>The Word of the Lord came expreſly to mee;</hi> the Word of the Lord had being in him, was ingraffed in him. When the Word is a word of being in our hearts, then it will be a word of power in your conſciences. That which comes from our hearts, will reach to yours, and will be effectuall in you; otherwiſe the Word is but an empty ſound, it cometh from the teeth outward, and reacheth but to your
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:123227:41"/> eares, and ſeldome goeth down into your ſouls.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Take this note, that there are principles of oppoſition in the deareſt ſervants of God to the work of his Spirit. It is ſaid, <hi>the hand of the Lord came upon mee; invaded mee,</hi> ſo ſome render it. I ſtood out againſt God, I had my carnall reaſonings, I had ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſſe and oppoſition in my will; I ſaid there was a Lion in the way, and I pleaded hard againſt this work and ſervice. But the Spirit of God came upon me, came mightily upon me, came with a ſtrong hand upon me, as he ſaith, came ſo upon me, that it ſubdued all my carnall reaſonings, ſubdued the ſtubbornneſs of my will, it removed all my ſhifts and pretences, and brought me off to go about the Work of God; Is it not thus with moſt Chriſtians? When you would pray, when you would do good, is not evill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with you? But when the Spirit of God cometh upon you, it will overcome that indiſpoſition, that ſluggiſhneſs, that oppoſition, it will work down diſtempers, and frame you ſweetly to go about the work of a God as it did <hi>Ezekiel.</hi>

                     <p n="6">6. That the Word and Ordinances of it, that viſions and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations do the heart of man reall good, when divine vertue goes along with them, otherwiſe not. What if <hi>Ezekiel</hi> had ſeen never ſo many viſions; what if God had ſpoken never ſo expreſly unto him? unleſſe the hand of God had been upon him too; unleſſe the Spirit of God had improved thoſe viſions, and ingraffed thoſe words in him, all had been as an empty ſound, all had been as meer ſhadowes and ſights to him. But when the Spirit of God goes along, then there is efficacy and benefit in any Ordinance; take away the Spirit from the Word and Ordinances of God, and they will be but dry bones without meat or marrow: take the Goſpel which is called the miniſtration of the Spirit, if the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit be not in it, the choiſeſt promiſes, the ſweeteſt truths there, what are they? they are <hi>Literae damnatoriae,</hi> and <hi>Leges mortis,</hi> they are letters and lawes of death to the ſoul. When the hand of the Lord is upon an Ordinance, and upon a man in that Ordinance, then is there good gotten, and then doth the ſoul gain. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. <hi>Our weapons are mighty through God.</hi>

                     <p n="7">7. That all ſpirituall good received and done by the Saints, is from the operation of Gods Spirit, which therefore is called Gods hand. <hi>Luke</hi> 11.20. <hi>If I by the finger or hand of God caſt out devils;</hi>
                        <pb n="61" facs="tcp:123227:41"/> this finger, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.28. is called the <hi>Spirit of God; If I by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God caſt out Devills.</hi> That which is called <hi>finger</hi> in one, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Spirit</hi> in the other. Now doe men receive any good? have you faith? have you love, patience, meekneſſe, underſtanding, zeale, godlineſſe, any, all graces? It is this hand of God that hath wrought them. Doe you doe any divine good unto others? It is this Spirit of God that workes by you, and inableth you to doe that good. <hi>Act.</hi> 6.10. <hi>They were not able to reſiſt the wiſedome and Spirit by which he ſpake.

It is needfull that Miniſters come not onely with Law and Goſpel, with the Word of God, but that they come with the very hand, even the Spirit and power of God; for all the efficacy and good done, is by the Spirit. If a Miniſter come and bring the letter onely without the Spirit, what evidence will there be to his owne ſoule, of the certaintie of thoſe things whereof he ſpeakes? How will he be able to ſee into the ſpiritualneſſe of them, to know that they are of God, and that they are to be commended to the people in the name of God, when he wants the Spirit of God to diſcerne them himſelfe? What prevalency can there be in the hearts of hearers, when the Miniſter comes not with demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Spirit? What bottome is there for the faith of men, where there is the wiſedome of words, without the power of the Spirit? The hearers get moſt good when Gods letters come to them not without his ſeale, evidencing they are his letters. Hence ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.4, 5. <hi>My preaching was not with inticing words of mans wiſedome, but in demonſtration of the Spirit and of power, that your faith ſhould not ſtand in the wiſedome of men, but in the power of God.</hi> Then doth the faith of hearers ſtand in the power of God, when the Miniſters come with evidence and demonſtration of the Spirit of God.</p>

                     <p>Laſt of all, From theſe three verſes generally conſidered, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve; That when Gods ſervants are in deepe afflictions, then are uſually brought in the ſweeteſt conſolations. Here is <hi>Ezekiel</hi> taken out of his own Countrey, deprived of his eſtate and friends, of the Temple, of Gods Ordinances and ſolemne Aſſemblies, and of all the ſweet and good that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> afforded: He is brought into <hi>Babylon,</hi> he is a captive there, he is ſolitary now by the River ſide, he was in a diſtreſt and forlorne condition. What man here would be in <hi>Babylon</hi> now, and not think himſelfe very miſerable?

While he is in this condition, God ſendeth an Angel unto him, and an Angel with bread to feed him, and with glad tydings to comfort him. <hi>John</hi> when he was in <hi>Patmos,</hi> bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by <hi>Domitian,</hi> in a place where were the condemned parties

The three Children, when they were in the fiery furnace, the fire did them no hurt, but looſe their bands and ſet them at libertie, and then one like the Sonne of God commeth and walketh amongſt them, and comforteth them in thoſe fiery flames. In deepe diſtreſſes then God doth often let out himſelfe: he dwelleth in the darkneſſe, and letteth out himſelfe, and becommeth light to thoſe that are in darkneſſe.

                     <p>The firſt is a Viſion of a tempeſt in this fourth verſe.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is of the foure living creatures, with their deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from this verſe to the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.</p>

                     <p>The fourth is of the Firmament, from the 22. verſe to the 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.</p>
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:123227:43"/>
                     <p>The fifth is of a Throne with one in it, from the 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi> to the end.</p>
                     <p>Some others put them all together, and make them one Viſion; theſe being all parts of it.</p>
                     <p>Before I come to open this Viſion, or any parts thereof, it will be needfull to ſhew you the ſcope of this Viſion, which will helpe us in the underſtanding of the ſame.</p>
                     <p>The ſcope of this Viſion is to ſet forth the glory of God; and this appeareth from the laſt verſe of the Chapter, where it is ſaid; <hi>This was the appearance of the likeneſſe of the glory of the Lord.</hi> The Spirit interprets all to be a manifeſtation of the glory of God.</p>
                     <p>This glory of God is evidenced two wayes:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. By his powerfull providence in the adminiſtration and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of all the creatures in the world; For all creatures are under the command of God, and he doth diſpoſe of them for what ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices he pleaſeth, and not onely in the world, but ſpecially in the Church is his active providence, preſerving, &amp; deſtroying as ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth beſt in his owne eyes, ſo that nothing is done there raſhly, or without his will; nothing otherwiſe, ſooner or later then he hath decreed; all creatures, actions, events, come under his will, rule, and power.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. By a repreſentation of Jeſus Chriſt, the Judge and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of this world, who is the brightneſſe of the glory of God, and the expreſſe image of his Perſon; and this from the 22. verſe to the end of the Chapter; as the other is from the 4. verſe to the 22.</p>
                     <p>This glory of God is preſented to <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in this Viſion, for theſe ends:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. To breed in him an high reverence of divine Majeſtie. The ſight of great and glorious things doe awaken our dull, heavie, ſenſuall ſpirits: naturally we are indifferent to the things of God, and unleſſe ſomething tranſcendent and glorious be preſented to us, like <hi>Gallio</hi> we care little for other things: therefore in <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.16. when the people ſaw the lightning, and heard the thunder, when God came downe upon the Mount in that glorious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, this awakened them, and bred an awfull reverence in them of divine Majeſtie; <hi>All the people that were in the Campe trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="65" facs="tcp:123227:43"/>2. To prepare and fit him for entertainment of what God ſhould ſpeake unto him. We are not alwayes in a frame to heare God ſpeake, there are great diſtempers in our ſpirits: you have all experience enough of the truth of this: therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46.10. <hi>Be ſtill and know that I am God;</hi> Be ſtill, let not your ſpirit be in a rage, taken up with the world, the cares, feares, pleaſures, and buſineſſes of it, be not parling with a luſt, but be ſtill and know that I am God.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is to incourage him to his work, and to frame his ſpirit to a ready execution thereof. <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was to enter upon a heavie taske, he was to deale with the ſtubborne <hi>Jewes,</hi> a rebellious people. He knew that <hi>Jeremiah</hi> had preached 35. yeares, and other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets in times better then he was in, and little or no good had been done upon this hard-hearted people. Therefore leſt <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſhould be diſcouraged, that his heart might not faint, but be quickned to the worke, the Lord doth ſhew him his glory in theſe Hieroglyphicks, his glory in theſe creatures, his glory in his Sonne, that ſo ſeeing the glory of God, he might be warm'd, oyl'd, and incourag'd to run about this worke. For the ſight of glory is po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with a gracious heart, to make it active for God. <hi>We cannot</hi> (ſays <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> in <hi>Act.</hi> 4.20.) <hi>but ſpeake the things which we have ſeene and heard.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 1.14. Mat. 17.1, 2.</note> Now they had ſeene his <hi>glory as the glory of the onely begotten Sonne of God.</hi> They had been in the mount, ſeene Chriſt transfigured, and <hi>his face ſhine as the Sunne.</hi> And having ſeene his glory and heard his voice, this incouraged them, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all difficulties, to be active for him. This was Gods way to appeare to his ſervants, to incourage them to the worke he would ſet them about.<note place="margin">Exod. 3.</note> God appeared to <hi>Moſes</hi> in a burning buſh. To <hi>Joſhua</hi> in a viſion like a man with a ſword in his hand.<note place="margin">Joſh. 5.13. 2 King. 6.17. Act. 10.</note> To <hi>Eliſha</hi> by horſes and chariots of fire. <hi>Peter</hi> being confirmed by a viſion of a ſheet let downe from heaven, goes and preacheth to the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> And <hi>Ezekiel</hi> here hath viſion upon viſion, that ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrongly confirmed, he might not feare the faces of <hi>Jewes</hi> or <hi>Babylonians,</hi> but proceed with life and ſpirit about the worke he was ſent.</p>
                     <p>Note: The ſight of Gods glory is very efficacious upon the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of men. If God let out his glory, it will worke ſtrangely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on good and bad. When they came to apprehend Chriſt, ſaith he
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:123227:44"/> to them,<note place="margin">Joh. 18.6.</note> 
                        <hi>I am he.</hi> It is conceived that Chriſt let out ſome glimpſe of his glory, this did ſo aſtoniſh them that preſently they recoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and fell to the ground. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> when he ſaw the glory of the Lord,<note place="margin">Iſa. 6.5, 6.</note> he cryeth out, <hi>Woe is me, I am undone, I am a man of uncleane lips, and I dwell among a people of uncleane lips.</hi> And then God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting his glory ſo farre for his good, that his lips were touched by an Angel; <hi>Now Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>here am I, ſend me,</hi> I am ready to goe, though it be on a meſſage of death, though it be to root up Nations and Kingdomes. So it was with <hi>Job, I have heard of thee</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>by the hearing of the eare,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Job 42.5, 6.</note> 
                        <hi>but now mine eye ſeeth thee,</hi> (that is, thy glory) <hi>Wherefore I abhorre my ſelfe in duſt and aſhes;</hi> I will ſpeake no more againſt God, I will doe whatſoever thou ſhalt command or expect at my hands. So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.5, 6. <hi>The glory of the Lord ſhall be revealed, and all fleſh ſhall ſee it together:</hi> And what then? <hi>All fleſh is as graſſe, and all the goodlineſſe thereof is as the flower of the field.</hi> There is no greater or more efficacious way, to take off your hearts from the creature,<note place="margin">Videnti Deum omnis creatura eſt anguſta.</note> then to behold the glory of God. There was no man that ever ſaw the glory of God, but he looked upon the creature as nothing afterward.</p>

                     <p>The Northern winds are very piercing; and if we reſpect the Prophet in this whirlewind, it was to purge the aire, that the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions might be clearer and more conſpicuous to his eyes, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

                     <p>But there is ſomething elſe in this North-wind; great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there is among Expoſitors concerning this viſion, and no man almoſt knoweth where to faſten; what I conceive to be the truth you ſhall have.</p>
                     <p>By this whirlwind from the North, is meant <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> with his army that ſhould come and beſiege <hi>Jeruſalem. Jer.</hi> 1.13, 14. this is ſet out under the repreſentation of a <hi>ſeething pot; I ſaw</hi> (ſaith he there) <hi>a ſeething pot from the face of the North;</hi> (ſo the Hebrew is) and what is that? <hi>Out of the North an evill ſhall break forth upon all the Inhabitants of the land;</hi> The evill is, <hi>The Families of the Kingdomes of the North ſhall come againſt Jeruſalem,</hi> verſ. 15.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> and his Army are compared to a whirlewind, in the ſudden riſing, ſwift going, and terrible execution.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In the ſudden riſing, winds (you know) riſe ſuddenly. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Suddenly there came a ſound from heaven, as of a ruſhing migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty wind,</hi> which ſheweth that winds do come unexpectedly. <hi>Jonah</hi> 1.4.

                     <p>How could this be ſudden, when the Prophets had foretold them of it long before?</p>
                     <p>To this I anſwer, firſt; That becauſe they did not believe what the Prophets did foretell, touching <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> and his deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

                     <p n="2">2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. Though they were foretold, though they did believe it, yet becauſe they were not prepared for it when it did come, therefore it was ſudden unto them. <hi>Luke</hi> 21.34. <hi>Take heed, leſt by any means your hearts be overcome with ſurfeiting and drunkenneſſe, and that day come upon you unawares:</hi> though men believe that evill ſhall come, if they be taken unawares, unprepared, it is ſudden to them. So theſe, either not believing, or not being prepared, though they did believe, the coming of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was to them as a whirle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind very ſudden.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In its ſwift going; The wind is ſaid to have wings, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.11. becauſe of its ſwiftneſſe and ſpeedy motion; and Ships that are driven by it, are ſaid to be ſwift, <hi>Job</hi> 9.26. And ſo it is ſaid of the <hi>Chaldean</hi> horſes, that they are ſwifter then Leopards. <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.8. Leopards are very ſwift creatures, ſo ſwift, that <hi>Claudian</hi> faſtens this Epithet upon them, <hi>Pardi fulminei,</hi> Leopards are as ſwift as lightening and thunder; and therefore, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.6. <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> is compared to a Leopard, becauſe of his ſpeedy conquering the world. Celerity in matters of war is of great moment: And it would do well, that thoſe that are now intereſſed in it, would make more ſpeed; for ſpeed doth great things. <hi>Alexander</hi> being asked the queſtion how he overcame the world in ſo little time, anſwered, By not delaying: every opportunity was taken. Theſe <hi>Chaldeans</hi> and their horſes were very ſwift, and they came with great ſpeed upon <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and therein reſembled the wind.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. In its terrible execution: A whirlewind, or any wind which bringeth a tempeſt, what dreadfull work doth it make? Houſes, Mountains, Trees, Steeples, are ſhaken and torn in pieces; what can ſtand before a tempeſtuous wind? You may ſee the power thereof in 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.11. <hi>A great ſtrong wind rent the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and brake in pieces the rocks.</hi> The ſtrength of rocks and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains was weakneſſe to the ſtrength of the winds; thoſe great
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:123227:45"/> veſſels at Sea, <hi>viz.</hi> Ships, when a ſtorm cometh, how are they bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and ſhaken, ſunk and ſplit againſt the rocks? There is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible execution done by the winds at Sea and Land, when they are in their ſtrength. So <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> and his forces were very terrible: <hi>Habak.</hi> 1.6. and ſo on, we may ſee the terribleneſſe of them; <hi>I will raiſe up the Chaldeans, a bitter and haſty nation;</hi> and verſe 7. <hi>They are terrible and dreadfull:</hi> and verſe 9. <hi>They ſhall come all for violence, their faces ſhall ſup up as the Eaſt-wind:</hi> that wind was moſt vehement and ſcorching in <hi>Judea,</hi> and devoured all that was green; ſo did the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> devoure and deſtroy all their pleaſant things; <hi>they ſhall gather the captives as the ſand.</hi> The wind drives great heaps of ſand together, raiſeth a mountain preſently, ſo ſhould they gather the captives as heaps of ſands. Then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, verſe 10. <hi>They ſhall ſcoffe at the Kings, and the Princes ſhall be a ſcorn unto them, they ſhall deride every ſtrong hold, for they ſhall heap duſt and take it.</hi> No perſon, no hold can ſtand before them. In theſe reſpects <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> and his army are compared to a whirlewind, and a whirlewind out of the North.</p>

They were a haſty and bitter nation, they rained down their wrath upon <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> they had inſtruments of death, they ſent out their thunder and lightening, and burnt the Houſe of God, the Kings houſe, and every great mans houſe in
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:123227:46"/> 
                        <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 25.9. A terrible ſtorm was now upon <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> when they ſhot their arrowes into the City, ſlew multitudes, burnt down all, and carried the people into captivity; what a ſtorm was here! So here God ſtorm'd <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi> his armie; and what are armies but clouds of blood and fire, the great ordnance of God, out of which he ſhoots thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolts of death, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 28.2. and by which he ſtorms the ſtrongeſt towns?</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Obſerve here; That winds, clouds, and all vapours are ſubject to the power of God. Hee calls them forth at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and caries them which way he pleaſeth to execute his will: he ſent the whirlewind, and the great cloud; theſe lawleſſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, over which no King, no Nation ever had command, (for who can command the winds or the clouds?) yet God hath ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute power over winds: <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.4. <hi>He gathereth the wind in his fiſt,</hi> he can open it, and let out a wind where and when he will, to ſhake the foundations of the earth: He hath the waters in a garment covered up in cloud, and he only can powre them out, and make great floods; He is the father of the great rain, <hi>Amos</hi> 5.8. <hi>He calleth for the waters of the Sea,</hi> (that is, the vapours whereof the clouds and rain are made) <hi>and powreth them out upon the face of the earth.</hi> It is God that flieth upon the wings of the wind; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.11. It is God that rideth upon the clouds, and makes them his Chariot, and walketh upon the wings of the wind; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.3. It is God that rideth upon the ſwift clouds; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 19.1. God hath the uſe of the winds as a Fowle of his wings, and can flutter and make a great or ſmall wind as he pleaſeth; God hath the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the clouds as a Prince of his chariot to drive it which way he pleaſeth.</p>
                     <p>If you have a wind at Sea or Land to do you good, remember that it came out of Gods hand; remember God rides upon that wind, and carried it that way you would have it: If the clouds, the bottles of heaven, be carried over your Gardens, Orchards, Lands, Habitations, Cities or Countreys, do water them and make them fruitfull, remember that God rideth in thoſe Chariots, that he openeth thoſe bottles of heaven, and lets down that which is ſweet and comfortable to the ſons of men: If they prove ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible unto you; if there be a ſtorm and tempeſt, remember it is
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:123227:47"/> God that ſends the ſtorme and tempeſt. All is in his hand.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That it is Gods prerogative to impoſe higher ſignifications upon things, then they have by nature. This whirlewinde out of the North, this great cloud, naturally had no other ſignification then other clouds and winds; God lifts them up to a higher ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and makes them to repreſent <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> and his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, his own wrath and vengeance in that <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> and in that Army of his. It is Gods priviledge to put things into a higher condition then they have by nature. No man, no Prince on earth could have put this ſignification upon that whirlewinde. The Rain-bow was before the flood, but had not that honour to be a witneſſe between God and man, that God would never drowne the world any more, till God himſelfe impos'd it. The braſen Serpent was no more then other braſſe, but by divine inſtitution it was made a type of Chriſt. Where ſuch inſtitution is not, no creature can be tranſlated to another or higher condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then that it was ſet in by the firſt creation, without ſin. To make garments ſignifie puritie, Croſſes Chriſt crucified, (beſides the ſuperſtition and injury in thruſting them out of their ranke) it's a preſumptuous ſtepping into the Throne of God, and a bold uſurpation of his prerogative; It belongeth unto him to impoſe ſignifications of a higher nature upon the creature then ordinarily it hath.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That the anger of God which way ſoever venting it ſelfe, makes a ſtorme and a terrible tempeſt. God was about to powre out his wrath by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> and his Army; and this prov'd ſuch a tempeſt, as ruin'd <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> this verified <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11.6. <hi>Vpon the wicked he ſhall raine ſnares, fire and brimſtone, and an horrible tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, the portion of their cup.</hi> When Gods wrath once breaks out, it will be terrible to all it falleth upon.</p>
                     <p>What therefore will wicked men doe when God ſhall come out like a whirlewinde, when God ſhall come out as a great cloud, thunder, lighten in the world, raine fire and brimſtone and an horrible tempeſt? When God ſhall doe this, what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of them? Wicked men in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.10, 11. are compared to a wall that is daubed up with untempered morter; When God ſhall come with a tempeſt and ſhake that wall, can it ſtand? No; it's ſaid it ſhall fall, a ſtormie winde ſhall rend it. The <hi>Jewes</hi> dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:123227:47"/> with untempered morter, and when the ſtorme came, they fell; many Chriſtians daube up themſelves with the untempered morter of their own righteouſneſſe, of vaine hopes, of doing this and that. But when this whirlewinde blows, they will downe. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.27. They are houſes built upon the ſand, and when the winds blow, the floods beat, and the raine falls, they will fall alſo, and fall from the hopes of heaven to the bottome of hell. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore looke to your foundation, looke that you be not built upon the ſand, but upon a rocke, and that you daube not with untem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered morter, for there is a tempeſt already begun.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That God can bring adverſe power from any quarter, he can raiſe winde and clouds from the North, from remote places, thoſe we little thinke of; he can make uſe of a luſty, bitter, and mercileſſe Nation, and that ſuddenly, to awaken a ſecure people, to correct his owne ſervants, and to plague his enemies. It's likely they had ſuch thoughts at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> as theſe; Surely <hi>Babylon</hi> is a great way off, <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> hath his hands full, none of the Kings of the earth will or dare come neare <hi>Jeruſalem: Lam.</hi> 4.12. Wee are in no ſuch danger as theſe timerous Prophets ſpeake of; Why ſhould we trouble our ſelves with needleſs fears? we will on in our wonted wayes: and are not ſuch as theſe our thoughts? doe not wee thinke that foraine enemies are ſo imployed and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up at home, that they have no leaſure to come and trouble us? But God can from the North bring a tempeſt, God can from fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine Nations bring in thoſe that can powre out their wrath up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and make as grievous a ſtorme as ever fell upon <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> We doe not beleeve, and they did not beleeve. But what if God doe not bring it from abroad, cannot he raiſe up a ſtorme from within? Is there not already a winde out of the North, a whirle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winde and a cloud raiſed? and how ſoone doe any of us know but there may be blackneſſe, darkneſſe, and the day of the Lord round about us, we may be ſuddenly invironed with winds and dreadfull ſtormes, ſuch as our hearts never thought of, and our eyes never ſaw? Let us not be ſecure, a bloudy tempeſt is amongſt us already. The drunkard maybe ſecure when he is at Sea aſleepe upon the top of the Maſt, (though it may coſt him his life for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo) but a ſober man will looke about him when he ſeeth the Ship ſhaken, and heareth the winds blow, and perceives the waves
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:123227:48"/> riſe; and if it be poſſible, ſave his owne life, and the Ship too. If you be ſober men, looke about you. Is not the ſtorme begun? Doe not the windes blow? Are not the clouds darke? Is not the day of the Lord upon us? If it be poſſible ſave your owne lives, and the Ship that you are in, that now begins to ſhake, to ſinke. The heathen Mariners had ſo much religion, that when there was a ſtorme every one cryed to his God; and ſo much charitie, as not to ſuffer <hi>Jonah</hi> to lie aſleepe, but goe to him and ſay, <hi>Awake thou ſleeper, what meaneſt thou? ariſe, call upon thy God,</hi> that if it may be, he may ſave both thee and us. Be not you behinde the heathen Mariners, ſhew ſo much religion and charitie in you, as every one to goe and call now upon his God. Cry to your God now, that he would ſtill the windes; That he would rebuke the waves; That he would ſtill this ſtorm. Cry to God now with all your ſtrength, and wraſtle with him night and day, that he may ſhew ſome mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to his Beloved, and not give her up to be a ſpoile to the hands of enemies. Awaken your <hi>Jonahs</hi> that are aſleepe in your houſes. Call upon husband, wife, friends, Miniſter, all, and every one to put to their hearts and hands, to ſecure this Ship that is almoſt now ſplit and falling in peeces. Now take your Cenſers, for wrath is gone out from the Lord, put fire and incenſe in them, that if it be poſſible,<note place="margin">Mat. 8.24.</note> you may ſtop the wrath. When the Diſciples were at Sea, and a ſtorme aroſe, Chriſt being with them aſleepe in the Ship, they awake him, ſaying, <hi>Lord ſave us, we periſh.</hi> So doe you, Chriſt ſeems to be aſleepe, awake him with your prayers, and ſay, Lord ſave us, wee are called by thy name, wee are Chriſtians, ſave us, elſe wee periſh. Chriſt you ſee preſently aroſe, rebuked the windes, and the Sea, and there was a great calme. Be not ſecure now of all times, but thinke with your ſelves what you would doe if all the Nations of the world were come againſt <hi>England,</hi> if all the Counties in <hi>England</hi> were in an uproare, if this Citie were beſieged and fire throwne into it to burne the houſes. Thinke what you would doe then, doe it now, fit and prepare your ſelves for the ſtroake of God in the ſtorme and tempeſt, that how ever it goe with your bodies, eſtates, liberties, or lives, yet it may goe well with your immortall ſoules.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That God diſpoſes of winds and clouds for what ſervices he pleaſes. A whirlewinde is made <hi>Elijahs</hi> chariot to heaven,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:123227:48"/> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2.11. The Lord hath his way in the windes, <hi>Nah.</hi> 1.3. He anſwered <hi>Job</hi> out of the whirlewinde, <hi>Chap.</hi> 40.6.

But this reacheth not the meaning yet in the Text, <hi>A fire infolding it ſelf: Zanchius</hi> thinks it rather a fierie globe which remov'd in the cloud, and like Cabbage leaves grow up into themſelves, and infolding, make a Globe; ſo the flames of this fire turned into themſelves, and became a globe; and it's probable to be this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it's ſaid, there was a brightneſs round about it, the fiery globe within begat that circular brightneſſe, which lightning being tranſparent could not do; and the rather it's thought to be this then lightning, becauſe the colour is ſaid to be as the colour of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, whereas if it had been lightning, that is tranſient, and the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour hardly obſervable; therefore it ſhould ſeem to be ſome fixed thing; I conceive it to be vapours in the clouds, kindling and burning into themſelves, the flame turning inward, and making a globe;<note place="margin">Ignis ſe accen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, <hi>Shindl.</hi>
                        </note> and thus I find it expounded, A fire kindling it ſelf: and ſo it is moſt naturall to the cloud to have vapours in it, which fire and kindle themſelves, and burn into the form of a globe. Now what is meant by this fire infolding it ſelf, or this fiery globe, is very doubtfull; they that come neereſt to the truth, take it to be the wrath of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> or rather the wrath of God in uſing <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> to burn the City and Temple; but with ſubmiſſion to the judgement of the learned and godly, I take the fire to be meant of ſin, the ſins of Prince and people, Prieſts and Prophets did kindle and involve them in the fire their own ſins took hold of and conſumed them. <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.28. <hi>His own iniquities ſhall take the wicked himſelf, and he ſhall be holden with the cords of his own ſin:</hi> A mans ſins will turn upon him, take hold of him and bind him; and ſo here <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> ſins kindle upon her ſelf, take hold of her and burn her: ſin we find in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cometh up to the nature of fire. <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.27. <hi>In the lips of the ungodly there is a burning fire;</hi> and it's likened to fire, becauſe of the deſtructive nature; whatſoever fire takes hold of, it conſumeth;
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:123227:49"/> and ſo doth ſin: <hi>Job</hi> 5.2. <hi>Wrath killeth the fooliſh man, and envy ſlayeth the ſilly one:</hi> and <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.32. <hi>The turning away of the ſimple ſhall ſlay them.</hi> So then <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> ſins, the ſins of Kings and Nobles, the ſins of Prophet, Prieſt and people, are here to be underſtood by this fire infolding it ſelf, which drew the wrath of God into <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſo kindled, fired, and conſumed them all.</p>
                     <p>From hence note, that the cauſe of Kingdomes, Cities, Prince and peoples ruine is in themſelves, their own ſins are the fire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding: <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.9. <hi>O Jeruſalem, thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelf,</hi> thou art the cauſe of thine own ſpoil and captivity, thou haſt ſet up the Calves, worſhipped them, and they bleat ſo againſt thee, that they have undone thee. <hi>Iſraels</hi> ſin was <hi>Iſraels</hi> deſtruction; and ſo <hi>Jeruſalems,</hi> it was not the whirlewind, nor the cloud; not <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar</hi> or his army, that could have made one breach upon <hi>Jeruſalems,</hi> or led one ſoul into captivity, if there had not been ſin amongſt them, it was their own ſin which kindled divine wrath, and brought in their deſtruction, otherwiſe they had been ſafe enough; <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> might have ſtood to this, been as great and glorious as ever. The principles of our mine are in our ſelves: Iron breeds the ruſt, garments the moths which devour them. The ill humors in a mans body, fire and conſume the houſe by a burning feaver; children breed the worms which bring them to their graves; and States the ſins which bring them to their ends; where ſin is bred and countenanced, it proves <hi>conſumptio totius,</hi> families, cities, kingdomes go down where ſin goes up. Let not kingdoms therfore blame God or others, but let them and all ſay, The root of the evill is in our ſelves, we ſhould never be laid waſt, if we were true to God, faithfull and cloſe to the rule; if we did not ſin, there would be no fire to conſume us and ours.</p>

                     <p>Now what is meant by this Amber or coal, there is great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute; ſome underſtand by it Chriſt, becauſe he is more precious then Amber, more lively then any burning coal whatſoever. But we muſt lay this ſenſe aſide, becauſe there is a Viſion of Chriſt in the latter end of the Chapter. The ſoundeſt Expoſitors by <hi>Chaſmal,</hi> leade us to ſome inferiour to Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the Angels, who are called Seraphims, <hi>Animalia ignea,</hi> as <hi>Kimchi</hi> hath it; of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raph,</hi> to burne, and Seraphims are fiery burning creatures, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.2. <hi>About it ſtood the Seraphims,</hi> that is, the fiery burning Angels; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the <hi>Chaſmal</hi> or burning coales here. So in <hi>Iudges</hi> 13.20. an Angel went up to heaven in a flame of fire, that element was moſt ſutable to Seraphicall and Angelicall nature. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6.17. There were horſes and chariots of fire round about <hi>Eliſha,</hi> and Angels were in thoſe chariots. They are likened to fire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their ardent and burning zeale to doe the will of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.20.</p>
                     <p>For the word <hi>[Colour]</hi> the colour of amber, in the Hebrew it is, the eye of amber, the organ is put for the object: ſo you have it uſed, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.7. <hi>The colour of it was as the colour of Bdelium;</hi> the Hebrew is, the eye of it was as the eye of <hi>Bdelium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now having given you the meaning of <hi>Chaſmal, viz.</hi> that he ſaw Angels of fiery colour, like to hot burning coales, ſo intenſe and zealous that they were ready to doe and execute whatſoever God would have done;</p>
                     <p>Note hence;</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That heavenly things are ſo tranſcendent, and we ſo weake, that we can comprehend or receive very little of them. They muſt be preſented in things beneath their excellency, to make us capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of a little of them.<note place="margin">Per corporales oſtenſiones in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporearum percipimus no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titiam. <hi>Prad.</hi>

Nicodemus</hi> a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> did not apprehend the doctrine of regeneration,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:123227:51"/> when expreſſed in his owne Dialect: had Chriſt ſpoken of the great things of the kingdome of heaven in their own nature, how could he or any of us have underſtood? Here wee ſee darkly and as in a glaſſe. God is pleaſed to goe in the way of man with us, to condeſcend to our capacities, and to preſent heavenly things in Hieroglyphicks, winds, clouds, fire and coales, that ſo we may have a little apprehenſion of the nature of thoſe things.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That heavenly Spirits are moſt pure and lively. So much the word <hi>Chaſmal</hi> leads us unto; it noteth coales that have no darkneſſe, no ſmoake in them, that are altogether fiery, and ſo lively as that they cannot be more lively. Such is God, he is light, and no darkneſſe, he is more lively then all the world beſide. He is <hi>Actus puriſſimus,</hi> all his actions exceed our apprehenſions. Such are Angels, they are pure and lively creatures, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.7.

                        </note> the ſeven Angels are clothed in pure and white linnen, and their breaſt girded with golden girdles: pure linnen they have and golden girdles, no ſpot in the linnen, no droſſe in the gold; to ſet out their puritie: and girt they are, to ſhew their readineſſe and zeale to doe the will of God: they are as burning lively coales, that if God doe but ſpeake the word, they run, they flie.

Uſefulneſſe; <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.4. much increaſe is by the ſtrength of the Ox, no creature more uſefull to the ſupport of a family then the Ox; for of old, all the plowing was by Oxen. <hi>Elijah</hi> findes <hi>Eliſha</hi> plowing with twelve yoke of Oxen, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.19. And <hi>Job</hi> had five hundred yoke of Oxen, and it's ſaid, <hi>they were plowing, Job</hi> 1.3.14. no mention of Horſes: and in ſome places of this Kingdome they make greateſt uſe of Oxen: by their ſtrength, Kingdomes and Families are maintained.

If an Ox or Sheep were ſtoln, and ſo killed, or ſold, the thiefe was to reſtore five for the Ox, four for the Sheep; and the reaſon was, becauſe of the ſervice and uſefulneſſe of thoſe creatures; they ſerved for ſacrifice to God, to

Oxen are needfull and uſefull creatures; and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels herein reſemble Oxen, they are miniſtring ſpirits, ſent out for the ſervice of Gods family, they live not to themſelves, but to the publike: In the <hi>Revelations</hi> you may reade what great ſervices the Angels are imployed in; they ſound the trumpets, and powre out the vials of Gods wrath, they preſerve the Saints from the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence of Devils and deviliſh men.</p>
                  <p>This inſtructs man to be like Angels in theſe qualities; if God command, call for any duty, to be obſequious, yeelding, and to ſay with <hi>Samuel, Here I am, Speak Lord, thy ſervant is willing to heare, ready to obey;</hi> and when we are in the ſervice, let us be faithfull, do it conſcionably, let us be patient, although we meet with delayes, oppoſitions, reproaches, and loſs; let us be ſerviceable and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to others; Angels have no benefit by their miniſtrations, God hath the glory, and man the good.</p>

                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 1. That Angels are fit for publike and great ſervice; they have four faces, a Mans, a Lions, an Oxes, an Eagles, which tels us they have all is requiſite to great undertakings; they have wiſdome to conſult, to contrive and manage the affairs of the world pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially; they have the ſtrength of a Lion to execute; they have the willingneſſe and faithfulneſſe of the Ox to rejoyce the heart of the commander; patience to undergo the difficulties of the work, and uſefulneſſe for the publique; they are quick-ſighted to diſcern and prevent the deſignes of enemies, and ſpeedy to diſpatch much in a little time, and that with cheerfulneſſe; this is meant by their four faces, which notes their perfection and fitneſſe for ſervice in all parts of the world; in regard of which, and the Prophet to whom this viſion was made, they are ſaid to have one face before, another behind, and on each ſide one; and that God doth uſe their ſervice
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:123227:60"/> in all creatures rationall and irrationall; they have the ſhapes of men, birds and beaſts.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 That ſuitable perſons ought to be imployed in publique and great ſervices; God imployes Angels in the government of the world, who are wiſe, truſty, ſtrong, and ſpeedy: and you know what men God calls for, in the State and Church, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18.21. <hi>Provide thou out of all the people able men, ſuch as fear God, men of truth, hating covetouſneſſe, and place ſuch over them to be Rulers of thouſands, hundreds, fifties, tens;</hi> he muſt ſearch amongſt all the people for ſuch, far and neer, and if in one Tribe he cannot find them, he muſt in another. The time hath been, that ſeniority, money, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, friendſhip, hath carryed the great places in this City, but you have ſmarted for it, in ſtead of good Angels you have had il ſpirits, now I hope you will not look who hath moſt money in his hutch, beſt friends to back him, but moſt wiſdome in his head, and zeal in his heart, and God on his ſide; now I truſt you will learn of God, and imploy ſuch as have the faces of men, Lions, Oxen and Eagles, men full of wiſdome, courage, truſt, ſerviceableneſſe to the publike, and of great diſpatch, ſuch ſhould be in the City, in the Army. So for the Church, you know what men God points you to, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.

                  <p n="3">3. That Angels being noble and glorious creatures, diſdain not to do ſervice to them that are far beneath themſelves. Man at firſt, when in his glory, was under the Angels, but now ſince he ſinn'd, he is fallen lower, as low as hell; man is now a miſerable, mortall creature, he hath a vile body, a defiled conſcience, and a polluted ſoul, yet Angels that are ſtiled Gods, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.5. ſo is the originall, that are Cherubims of glory; <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.5. that are holy; <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.31. Elect; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.21. that are of the privie Councell of Heaven, and the life-guard of God himſelf, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.10. even theſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed creatures are not aſhamed to ſerve us, though we have the ſent of the earth and hell about us, though we do oft grieve and offend them with our ſinfull carriages, and the great God their Lord and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:123227:61"/> Maſter, yet they deſpiſe us not, but cheerfully miniſter unto us. Would any great Prince attend a mean man full of ſores and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine? if ſo, it argues wonderfull humility; it's more that Angels do, in waiting upon us: it's monſtrous pride then in men that have parts, place, honour, greatneſſe, grace, what ever it be, not to ſtoop to thoſe that are inferiour: thou haſt not more worth in thee any way then an Angel hath: and Angels condeſcend to ſerve us, therefore let not us minde high things, but condeſcend to men of low eſtate, and not be wiſe in our own conceit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.16.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That God affects ſpeed in his ſervice; Angels are ſwift as Eagles, and diſpatch great things in a little time, they know a dull lazie motion is not the motion heaven approves, <hi>Zach.</hi> 2.4. ſaith one Angel to another, Run, ſpeak to the young man; going is not ſufficient, where running can be had: <hi>Feſtina lente,</hi> is not a Motto for heaven gates; In the worſt work that ever was in the world, Chriſt calls for ſpeed, <hi>What thou doſt do quickly,</hi> Joh. 13.27. when <hi>Judas</hi> was about his treaſon. Speed and life in buſineſſes is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, acceptable: <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.25. <hi>Agree with thine adverſary quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi>

                     <hi>Darius</hi> would have his decree done ſpeedily, <hi>Ezra</hi> 6.12. and God would have his Decrees and Will fulfilled, done with ſpeed: It's Gods will now, that you ſhould help him againſt the mighty. When the Temple was to be built, the people came ſo faſt, brought in ſo much, that they were bid to ſtay, and that work of theirs was pleaſing to God and man.

                  <p>In the the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe you have one thing more touching their faces, and that is, <hi>their faces were ſtretched upwards, thus were their faces;</hi> it's in your books, as if it had reference only to the former verſe and not to that followes in the eleventh; but <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus</hi> and others that render the Hebrew exactly, reade it thus: <hi>But their faces and their wings were ſtretched upwards;</hi> it's true, they have the faces of men and beaſts, but they are ſtretched upward, they looked up to him that ſate upon the Throne, which was Chriſt: the Cherubims faces, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.20, 21. were towards the Mercy-ſeat, and that was above upon the Ark; ſo that there and here, the Cherubims, theſe Angels looke upward.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſer.</hi> 1. That all creatures depend upon Chriſt, theſe Angels
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:123227:61"/> have the faces of Men, Lions, Oxen, Eagles, and look up to him; if there were nothing in it but this, that Angels in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture looking up, it might convince us, that all inferiour creatures do depend upon him, as well as thoſe noble ones; but when they come in with the faces of other creatures looking up, it's cleere evidence, that all depend upon Chriſt: <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16, 17. <hi>By him were all things created that are in heaven, and that are in earth, viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and inviſible, whether Thrones or Dominions, Principalities or Powers, all things were created by him, and for him, and by him all things do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt:</hi> he holds all in his hand, heaven and earth, men and Angels, they all conſiſt and ſubſiſt in him. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. <hi>He upholds all things by the word of his power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That in all our miniſtrations, we are to have our inſtructions and directions from Chriſt: Angels look up to him, if hee ſpeak they hear, they move and act, if not, they ſtir not. <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> did nothing in the State or Church, without direction from God: Princes muſt look into the Law of God continually, <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.7. that they may do things warrantably: the <hi>Centurions</hi> ſouldiers and ſervants did come, go, and do at his appointment, not their own; and Angels run not of their own heads, they will heare a word of command, have a commiſſion from Chriſt, before they go. It's not enough that wee be knowing, full of courage, quick to diſpatch much, a Commiſſion, a Warrant from God we muſt have, elſe all our doing is nothing; nay, let us do the will of God without knowing, wee are warranted by God to do it; it's rather ſin then ſervice, <hi>Pro.</hi> 3.5, 6. <hi>Lean not to thine own underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> let it be never ſo great, acute, cleere, it's not beyond Angels, they look up to God, and ſo muſt thou, <hi>In all thy wayes acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him, and he ſhall direct thy paths.</hi> Chriſt is the great Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and wee muſt not in one or two, or ſome great exigence of buſineſſe conſult with him, but in all our wayes, what ever we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt for our ſelves, families, State, Church, we muſt conſult with him ſits upon the Throne, and he will direct our paths; Moſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry in their wayes, or make little progreſſe, becauſe they conſult not at all, or very little with Chriſt; whereas if men did conſult with Chriſt, and do all upon his warrant, upon a divine ground, they ſhould never miſcarry in their ways, but proceed farther in the paths of godlineſſe in a few weeks, then they did before in may

                  <p n="3">3. That the pleaſure of Chriſt is worthy our waiting for; An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels look up and attend what he will ſay, and make known unto them; theſe holy, glorious and mighty creatures think not much to wait upon Chriſt, and exerciſe their patience till he pleaſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal his minde. Chriſt is a great King, the only Counſellour, and his counſell of infinite worth, and it's not State, but equity, that all creatures wait upon him, Angels do it, &amp; ſhall we grudge at it? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 123.1, 2. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwelleſt in the heavens.

Let the reſolution of the Prophet be thine, <hi>I will look unto the Lord, I will wait for the God of my ſalvation, my God will hear mee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. That Chriſt is an object of admiration and adoration: The looking upwards is <hi>Signum admirationis &amp; typus reverentiae;</hi> the Cherubims looked towards the Mercy-ſeate, admiring and adoring him was figured by it; and wee lift up our faces towards heaven, when we admire and adore God: you have the phraſe in <hi>Job</hi> 22.26. <hi>Thou ſhalt have thy delight in the Almightie, and lift up thy face unto God;</hi> That is, admire and adore that God thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteſt in.

                  <p>Angels are ſet forth to us in Scripture with wings: here with foure; In <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. with ſix wings each of them: and they are ſaid to be winged for the agilitie of their natures, and ſwift motion in executing their office.<note place="margin">Omnis ſpiritus ales eſt.</note> 
                     <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith, Every Spirit is winged, they fly in a moment into any part of the world, to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the commands of God. <hi>Gabriel</hi> came flying to <hi>Daniel,</hi> Chap. 9.21. and that ſwiftly. Aſtronomers obſerve, that from the center of the earth (which is 3000. to the ſurface) up to the Sunne is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove foure millions of miles, to the Firmament, where the fixed ſtarres are,<note place="margin">Clavius in Sphaeram.

So that according to their account, it muſt be above 160. millions from heaven to earth; and this ſpace the Angel came flying in a little time: we thinke a Bullet out of a Musket flies ſwiftly, and it doth, for it hits the bird or mark ere the report is heard, and will fly 180. miles in an houre, according to its motion. The Sunne moves ſwifter 1160000 miles in one houre; the fixed ſtarres about the aequinoctiall Moone 42. millions of miles each houre; and yet the motion of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel is ſwifter, being a Spirit, and paſſing through the ayre without oppoſition; no creature in heaven or earth moves faſter then an Angel.</p>
                  <p>Their wings are foure; but the Seraphims in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. and the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:123227:63"/> foure Beaſts in <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. are ſet out by ſix wings each of them. A queſtion hereupon ariſes; Why the Viſions being correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, the Angels here are deſcribed onely with foure wings: <hi>Anſ.</hi> That paire of wings is wanting here did cover the face of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaiah</hi> his Seraphims, and <hi>Johns</hi> foure beaſts; for they ſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the throne and face of God, were not able to behold ſuch Majeſtie, brightneſſe, and glory, with open face, although they were moſt pure creatures. We cannot look upon the Sunne in its ſtrength and glory, but we cover our eyes with our hand; ſo they their faces with their wings; now here was ſomething in ſtead of theſe wings, and did the office of thoſe wings, and that was the Firmament: <hi>Ver.</hi> 22. <hi>The likeneſſe of the firmament upon the heads of the living creatures:</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 26. <hi>Above the firmament was the throne.</hi> This firmament interpoſed between the luſtre of divine glory, and their eyes, as the wings did in the Prophets and Apoſtles viſion, and therefore here was no need of that paire of wings; they were not before the throne, but <hi>ſub expanſo,</hi> and to doe works beneath in the world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> That the glory and Majeſty of God is ſuch as no eye can fully behold; there wings, here the firmament is interpoſed between God and Angels. When God came downe upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and manifeſted his majeſtie and glory, what ſaid the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? <hi>Speake thou to us, and not the Lord, leſt we die.</hi> They could not endure the ſhine of <hi>Moſes</hi> face, much leſſe the luſtre and majeſtie of the Lords; ſomething muſt interveene, elſe man dyes for it.</p>
                  <p>Touching the wings of theſe our Angels, three things are laid downe; 1. The conjunction of their wings; 2. The Extention of them; 3. The uſe.</p>
                  <p>The Conjunction is in the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe; <hi>Their wings were joyned one to another;</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>Two wings of every one were joyned one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> The extremitie of their wings when ſtretched out and ready to flie, did touch one another; ſo as they ſeem'd to have but one wing.</p>

Could wee behold the actions and works of Angels, wee ſhould ſee ſuch glory and beauty, as never was ſeene in the works of men. If we look upon a building that is uniforme, and every part proportionable, wee are much taken with it: A garden that is drawne out exactly, and every thing in it ſet in order: An Army that keepeth ranke and poſture, and proceeds in all things according to rule, how beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull and comely are they? All the actions of Angels are ſuch, one runneth not before another, one is not divided from another, one diſallowes not what another doth, but their harmony and correſpondency is ſuch, that if a man could ſee the ſame, he would be raviſhed with the works of Angels. <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Where envying and ſtrife is, there is confuſion;</hi> but among Angels there is no envie, no ſtrife, ſo no confuſion.</p>

That wee ſhould joyne our helps for furtherance of the works of God: Angels joyne their wings, and afford help to each other to doe the will of God; Devils and wicked men joyne toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt God and his wayes; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.2. <hi>The Kings of the earth ſet themſelves, and the Rulers take counſell together againſt the Lord, and againſt his Anointed, &amp;c.</hi> And good men ſhould joyne together, their heads, their purſes and abilities whatſoever, to further Gods worke. If Angels appeare and put forth their wings to doe the will of their God, let us appeare and put forth our hands to doe the worke of our God.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing about their wings is, they were ſtretched up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, not let downe, drawne up, reſting upon their bodies, but extended as ready for ſervice as might be, <hi>ver.</hi> 11.</p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:123227:64"/>
                  <p>This notes unto us the readineſſe of Angels to doe the will of Chriſt; their faces look up, attend his commands, and their wings are ſtretched out to fly about them as ſoone as they are made knowne; as a Hawke that is upon the wing, watches till the fowle riſe, and then falls upon her, and flyes after her immediately. Angels are upon the wing before the command goes out, and when it's out, God ſhall not need to uſe motives or arguments to put them on. The manifeſtation of his will, is the ſtrongeſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive unto them; and it ſhould be ſo with us; We pray that Gods will may be done on earth as it's done in heaven; the meere mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of Gods will therefore ſhould prevaile with us as with Angels; but let God manifeſt his will, bring forth his ſtrong ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to move us, yet we have no wings, or if wings, not ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched forth, or if ſtretched forth, wee rather flag then fly with them.</p>
                  <p>The third thing is the covering of the wings, <hi>ver.</hi> 11.<note place="margin">Femora.</note> two co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered their bodies, their thighes, feet; that is in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.1. their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comely parts: which are in Scripture-phraſe call'd <hi>the feete.</hi> One wing did cover the fore-part of their body, another their hinder parts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. In this covering of their bodies, God propounds them a patterne of chaſtitie and modeſtie unto us; Thoſe parts are hid, which might uncovered, argue diſreverence of God, or concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence in them, or be offenſive unto men: God loves chaſte ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and chaſte behaviours; the Angels are very chaſte, and would not have any undecent thing objected to divine view, whoſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and majeſtie they adore;<note place="margin">Nihil impurum in conſpectum Dei veniat.</note> No impure thing muſt come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſight of God, therefore God ordered, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.26.

It notes out to us that Angelicall nature is a thing hidden, and too high for us, while we are in our houſes of clay, their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are beyond the reach of mans braine, and that wee are ſo farre from the knowledge of Gods face, nature, and abilitie to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them, that we cannot know and behold the loweſt parts, the very feet of Angels, they are vail'd up from us: As too tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent

Such is the beauty, wiſdome, ſtrength, uſe and celeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Angels in Gods ſervice, that man is apt to deifie them. <hi>John</hi> falls down to worſhip before the feete of an Angel, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.8.

And ſhould the Angels ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to us in their natures without being covered up, wee ſhould take them to be Gods; but they will not have that honour, they will hide their beauty and excellency, and deſire the glory onely be given to God.</p>

                        <hi>Obſer.</hi> 1. That the Angels are unpolluted in all their miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: they contract no filth, no ſoile to their feet; when they are in motion they are pure ſpirits, act purely, and abide moſt pure, their feet are like poliſhed, not polluted, burniſhed, not blemiſhed braſſe, and ſo hold forth to us an example of purity in our mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations; that wee ſhould be converſant in them, ſo as to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemiſhed, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8. <hi>lifting up holy hands, &amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.11. <hi>What manner of perſons ought yee to be in all manner of holy converſation?</hi> here it's anſwered, like Angels.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That the works of God by Angels or men done rightly with a ſtreight foot, that is, done according to Gods will, have much glory and efficacy in them, they ſhine like the poliſhed braſſe, there is their glory; and ſparkle, there is their efficacy. When the Angel deſtroyed <hi>Senacharibs</hi> hoſt, what glory and efficacy was in that work? When the Angel came to <hi>Manoah,</hi> and went up from him in a flame of fire, how glorious was this ſight, how ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious was the work in the heart of <hi>Manoah? John</hi> preached the truth with a right foot, and without delay, when call'd to it; <hi>and hee was a burning and a ſhining light,</hi> Joh. 5.35. <hi>Herod</hi> found him ſo: <hi>Mark</hi> 6.20. <hi>He feared John, knowing hee was a juſt and holy man,</hi> the glory of his juſtice and holineſſe ſhines into his head, and the power of them affected his heart; hee knew, hee feared; actions done according to Gods will, hold forth much of God in them; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.24. <hi>If an unbeliever come in and heare them prophecy,</hi> that is, according to the minde of God, carry the action as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the Church and the preſence of God, <hi>he is convinced,</hi> and almoſt converted, and ſaith, <hi>God is in you of a truth;</hi> hee ſees ſo much glory, feels ſo much power, that hee can contain no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52.7. <hi>Their feet are beautifull to your eyes, and their actions are efficacious in your hearts;</hi> Gods will is the Standard and meaſure of all actions, and when they are done according to it, they are very glorious and beautifull.</p>

                     <hi>Obſer.</hi> 1. That Angels are fit for ſervice; they have hands, and hands are not made in vain; they are for work: where there are no hands, no power, ſtrength, or way to put forth that power, there is no fitneſſe for ſervice; but Angels have power and wayes to execute that power; they have hands, not for ornament, but for action.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That Angels do their works rationally, they have the hands
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:123227:67"/> of a man; look as men do manage the works of their hands ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſly and wiſely, ſo do Angels; there is nothing defective, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous, perverſe, raſh, indiſcreet, or culpable in their miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they know all circumſtances, and miſſe not in any: how wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did the Angel manage the buſineſſe with <hi>Mary?

                  <p n="4">4. That Angels are great agents, and do much ſervice; they have hands on their foure ſides, at leaſt they had four hands, and they were able to do much, and great ſervice; ſome make more; and no hands of theirs is idle: one Angel can do more then thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of men, witneſſe that great ſlaughter in a night, and other things formerly ſpoken of. <hi>Briareus,</hi> a great doer is ſaid to have an hundred hands.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That God doth carry on his works here in the world by inviſible vertue, by hands under wings, by wayes and means not ſeen: There is <hi>vis plaſtica</hi> in the womb, which forms and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the birth, yet is not ſeen; and in the womb of the world God hath <hi>vires plaſticae,</hi> which form and perfect his works, yet not ſeen; much is done by the power of Angels, yet their power not ſeen. Mighty things are done by Gods Spirit in the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances in the Aſſembly, in our hearts, and yet Gods Spirit is an inviſible agent: the Miniſter, the Word would not do it, unleſſe ſome inviſible vertue went along therewith, <hi>Zaeh.</hi> 4.2, 3. though none were found to powre oile into the Lamps, yet God had Olive trees were not thought of, nor ſeen: <hi>Zachary</hi> ſaw not, the Candleſtick, Bowle, Lamps, or two Olive trees, till the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel awakened him, and made him ſee, that God had wayes to communicate vertue unto the Church he knew not of, and that though the Church were poor, low, not able to make a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Army to carry them to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and plant them there, yet he had his Spirit to work it out for them; and therefore ſaith, Not by might, not by power, but by my Spirit, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.8. <hi>The Lord ſhall conſume Antichriſt by the Spirit of his mouth:</hi> and ſo the two witneſſes, <hi>Fire goes out of their mouths and devours their adverſaries, Rev.</hi> 11.5. in an inviſible way, by a ſecret work: It was a hand under the wing that made peace betwixt <hi>Scotland</hi> and us, that ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered this Parliament, that hath, and doth keep it; it's invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible vertue that hath made them unanimous and magnanimous; inviſible vertue that upholds this Kingdome, that reſtrains the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of wrath, that daunts the adverſary, that hath ſhaken the Prelacy, and brought forth the great things in our dayes; it's the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:123227:68"/> hand under the wing that hath opened the hearts and purſes of many to further the great ſervice in hand.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That wee are to do Gods works without noiſe or notice of our ſelves; Angels that are agents for God, have their hands un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their wings, their actions are ſeen, but not their hands. In <hi>Jud.</hi> 13. when <hi>Manoah</hi> Catechized the Angel, and asked him, <hi>What is thy name?</hi> v. 17. the Angel would not tell him, but ſaid, <hi>Why askeſt thou thus after my name, ſeeing it is ſecret?</hi> ver. 18. And you ſhall not finde the names of above two Angels in Scripture, <hi>Gabriel</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael.</hi> Angels are jealous of Gods glory, and had rather conceale their hands and names, then God ſhould loſe the leaſt degree of his glory: for <hi>Manoah</hi> would therefore have known his name, that he might have honoured the Angel afterward; and we are very apt to look at the inſtrument, and neglect the principall: it's wiſdome to muffle up our ſelves and to hold forth God as much as may be <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee your good works, &amp;c.</hi> he doth not ſay, that they may ſee you, but ſee your good works, and glorifie their father, not you: As Fiſhers, they would have the bait ſeen, not themſelves; they would catch the fiſh with their bait, not ſcare them with their ſight. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Take heed you do not your almes before men to be ſeen of them;</hi> almes muſt be given, but wee and our hands muſt be hid. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts the <hi>Philippians,</hi> to <hi>hold forth the word of life,</hi> Phil. 2.16. not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but the Word of God which is the word of life.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. That their operations and preſence are together; they are not in heaven, and ſo work on earth, or in one part of the world and work in another, but their hands are under their wings, whither their wings do carry them, there they act, and not elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. The Angel came down to ſtir the water in the pool, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.4. and cure the Party that ſtept in firſt; they have not that power to work at any diſtance.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. That Angelicall vertue and nature is hid from us, it's too high for our capacity; their hands, their operative vertue we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſcover, or ſee into: a little of the Angels is preſented to us by theſe faces, wings, feet, hands, &amp;c. but the diſtinct know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Angels as Angels is reſerv'd til wee are like the Angels in heaven; therefore wee muſt not intrude into thoſe things which we have not ſeen, vainly puft up with our fleſhly minds, but be

                  <p>The Solution of this doubt is, that the Angels being in their work appointed of God, went on without turning or looking back til they came to the iſſue and end of it, til they came to the place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and then they returned unto God to give account of their ſervice, and to receive new inſtructions.

                     <p>Here you have the operation of this fire: <hi>it was light,</hi> that is, it did inlighten the Angels; they ſaw by this light what was to be done in this great deſign of Chriſt in ſaving the innocent, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing the guilty.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 1. That the Lord Chriſt doth uſe Angels in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his judgements upon ſinners; an Angel ſmote <hi>Herod, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacheribs</hi> hoſt, <hi>Pharaohs</hi> firſt-born, the <hi>Sodomites.

                     <p n="2">2. That Angels are zealous, forward and effectuall in executing judgements upon delinquents; they are burning Coals, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.7. they are called a flame of fire; fire is hot, and notes their zeal and forwardneſſe; it's active and conſuming, which notes their effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alneſſe: Angels are like the fire that fell upon <hi>Elijah's</hi> ſacrifice, which conſumed the ſacrifice, the wood, ſtones, duſt, and licked up the water, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.38. So effectuall was that fire, that nothing could ſtand before it; and when the Lord Chriſt ſends out Angels, none can ſtand before them, they are ſo zealous of, and effectuall in the execution of his judgements. The wicked are but as the wood, ſtones, duſt and water, theſe flames of fire will conſume them. This ſhould quicken Magiſtrates and thoſe be armed with authority, to be zealous and forward in puniſhing malefactors, and executing judgement upon delinquents. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.4. The ſword is not given them in vain, they are revengers of Gods quarrell, and it's Angelicall to execute wrath upon them do evill; it was <hi>Sauls</hi> ſin that he ſpared <hi>Agag,</hi> but <hi>Samuels</hi> glory that hee hewed him in pieces, hee was zealous, forward and effectuall in it; ſo <hi>Aſa</hi> in removing his mother <hi>Maachah</hi> from being Queen, becauſe ſhe had made an Idoll in a grove, which he cut down, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.16. and brake her Idoll in pieces, and burnt it. Thoſe are appointed of God to ſee juſtice done, if they do it not, become guilty them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Old <hi>Eli</hi> a Judge in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> becauſe hee was too partiall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his ſons, God was angry, and his end was ſad. <hi>Lewis</hi> the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, King of <hi>France,</hi> having pardoned a murtherer twice, and

                     <p n="3">3. That Angels have new influence from Chriſt ſuitable to the Miniſtration they are to be imployed in; though Angels be crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of much knowledge, wiſdome, ſtrength, ſpeed, and uſefulneſs, yet when Chriſt is to imploy them, they muſt have new vertue and influence; it went up and down among the living creatures: Let them be as burning coals, they have need of more heat; let them be as lamps, they have need of more light, their ſervices are great, and Chriſt contributes unto them continually: as they have new inſtructions,<note place="margin">Quae adſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lares vocatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; effectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes corum ſunt neceſſariae.</note> ſo new acceſſions and additions of vertue which are needfull to their callings and operations. If they have need of divine vertue to further them in their operations, much more have we need of freſh ſupplies. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.5. <hi>Without me yee can do nothing;</hi> hee ſaith not, you may do ſomething, or you can do little, but plainly, <hi>without mee you can do nothing;</hi> it's the vertue and influence of Chriſt which inables Angels and men to do the duties of their places and callings, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13. <hi>I can do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthens me;</hi> when <hi>Hee</hi> ſits upon the Throne, ſends out fire and flame, light and heat to ſtrengthen us, then can wee do all things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.5. There are difference of admininiſtrations, but the ſame Lord; it's the Lord Chriſt, that appoints the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of men and Angels, that gives direction about them with ſupplyes of grace and ſtrength, to exerciſe them; when we go about any imployments of our generall and particular callings, wee ſhould conſider our own impotency, and look up to Chriſt, who hath all fulneſſe, and is ready to ſend out vertue to ſupply all our wants; therefore <hi>Paul</hi> tels the <hi>Philippians, Chap.</hi> 4. ver. 19.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:123227:75"/> 
                        <hi>My God ſhall ſupply all your need according to his riches in glory, by Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. That the divine vertue comes from Chriſt, is an active thing, it went up and down, it reſted not. Men have ſought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the perpetuall motion, and lo, here it is: this vertue acted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually in the Angels; it went not by a tranſitive motion, from one Angel to another, but the motion was immanent, continually acting in them, and therefore it is called fire, which is a living active thing. The Word of God was as fire. <hi>Jer.</hi> 20.9. <hi>His Word was within mine heart as a burning fire ſhut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not ſtay;</hi> it overcame him, and quickened him up to his work, when hee thought to preach no more; many a Chriſtian thinks to heare, pray, reade, meditate, receive no more, but there is vertue gone out from Chriſt, that will walk up and down in them, and cauſe them to fall to it again: that vertue comes forth from Chriſt, is no dull thing. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. <hi>Paul</hi> had fire from Chriſt, and it ſet him awork; <hi>I laboured more abundantly then they all;</hi> ſee how active he was, hee exceeded all the reſt of the Apoſtles; and how came that about? what me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall was he made of? he had fire from Chriſt, <hi>it was not I, but the grace of God that was with mee,</hi> that went up and down in him, and fired his affections and ſpirit. <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 39.3. thought to be ſilent, and not to ſpeak any more before the wicked, I, even from good conference he refrained; but what was the iſſue? <hi>my heart was hot within mee;</hi> the vertue and fire he had from Chriſt began to work, <hi>while I was muſing, the fire burned and flamed out, then I ſpake;</hi> Hee could hold no longer: So <hi>Acts</hi> 4.20. <hi>Wee cannot but ſpeak the things we have ſeen and heard,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. That actions done by divine vertue, afford light and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: the fire went up and down among the Angels, put them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on execution of judgement; and from hence, (theſe actions being ſo done) prove light and lightning to the world; they are ſeen, and ſeen far. They are light to the godly: when Angels execute Gods judgements upon ſinners, the Saints ſee much in it; they ſee matter of feare and praiſe; of feare, in that Gods power, wrath, and hatred are manifeſted in them againſt ſin and ſinners: of praiſe, in that themſelves are delivered, and juſtice is performed. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58.10, 11. <hi>The righteous ſhall rejoyce when hee ſeeth the venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:123227:75"/> hee ſhall waſh his feet in the blood of the wicked:</hi> when the wicked are taken away by a divine ſtroke, by the hand of juſtice, and God hath the glory of his juſtice, the righteous rejoyce at it: but is that all? no, <hi>Hee waſheth his feet in the blood of the wicked,</hi> that is, by this judgement he fears and reformes; it's a metaphor taken from the practice of thoſe parts, where they went bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot, or with Sandalls, and ſo contracted much filth, and uſed to waſh and cleanſe their feet when they came in; ſo here, the godly ſeeing the hand of God upon the wicked, feares, and judges himſelf for his ſins, purges his conſcience and affections, and ſtands now in awe of that God who hath ſtricken the wicked for thoſe ſins, which hee himſelf in part is guilty of. <hi>Waldus,</hi> a man of note in <hi>Lions,</hi> ſeeing one ſtruck dead in his preſence, he waſhed his hands in his blood, for preſently he gave almes to the poor, inſtructed his family in the true knowledge of God, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted all came unto him to repentance and holineſſe of life.</p>
                     <p>They are lightning to the wicked, that is, dreadfull and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding. In this worke of executing judgement, as they are lamps to light the godly, ſo they are burning coales, and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to deſtroy the wicked. How terrible was the deſtroying An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel when the plague was in <hi>Davids</hi> dayes? <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. when the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels powred out their vials of wrath, how dreadfull were they? men blaſphemed and repented not, to give glory to God.</p>

                  <p>Theſe wheels being four, repreſent to us the four parts of the world, Eaſtern, Weſtern, Northern, Southern, that in them are great ſtirs and changes.</p>
                  <p>The next thing in this verſe, is the place; <hi>I ſaw one wheel upon the earth:</hi> how could that be, when <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſaw the viſion in heaven?</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is a viſion, and it appeared to him to be on the earth, not the true earth, but the earth in a viſion: as in pictures if a wheel, a Chariot, a City, be drawn, and preſented to the eye, they are preſented as being upon the earth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 1. That all inferiour cauſes, wheels, inſtruments, agents whatſoever, are but as one wheel before the Lord. All things in the four quarters of the world were preſented by God to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet as one wheel; to us they are many, mighty, divers, contrary, infinite, but unto God they are otherwiſe, all the Armies, Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Kingdoms, Crowns, Agents in this world are but one cauſe, one wheel before the great God, they are a ſmall thing to him. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.15, 16, 17. <hi>Behold, the nations are as the drop of a bucket, and are counted as the ſmall duſt of the ballance: behold, hee taketh up the Iſles as a very little thing; Lebanon is not ſufficient to burn, nor the beaſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſufficient for a burnt offering: all nations before him are as nothing, and they are counted to him leſſe then nothing, and vanity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That changes, ſtirs, and tumults, are here on the earth, not in heaven; the Prophet ſaw the wheels on earth, not in heaven; there be no wheelings, no turnings, no troubles, no wars, no deaths, no diſeaſes, no ſins, no feares, no teares, no wicked men, no wicked thing, and ſo no changes; it's only the prerogative of heaven, to ſay, <hi>I am the Lord, I change not,</hi> Mal. 3.6. the world cannot ſay it. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.17. <hi>With him is no variableneſſe, or ſhadow of turning;</hi> in God and heaven, there is nothing of the wheel, all is conſtant, immutable, but on earth it's contrary, the things under the Sun are vanity, inconſtancy, and change it ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That all the inferiour agents and cauſes, are at the diſpoſe of the ſuperiour, of Angels; they have a great intereſt in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the world, the wheel is by the living creatures, at their feet, to move and turn it which way they pleaſe; if they will beſpeak wars in the North, or South; if they will have the world in an uproare, it's done; Angels are Gods hands and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties, in the adminiſtration of all things here below, in the world
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:123227:79"/> God ſupports and ſubverts kingdomes by them. <hi>Dan.</hi> 10. <hi>Gabriel</hi> tels <hi>Daniel,</hi> that hee withſtood the Prince of <hi>Perſia</hi> 21. dayes, and his counſellers that ſought to oppreſſe the people of God, and that hee would go again and fight with him; Kingdomes, and the affaires of them, yea, the quarters of the world, under God are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by Angels; and while Angelicall and divine protection are over kingdomes, they proſper, but when God is provoked by the ſins of a people, hee leaves the wheels of that Kingdome to men and devils, it runs to ruine. Then the Princes and Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates are deluded with ſtrong deluſions, grow tyrannicall, Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, falſe, hoſtile, &amp;c. then the kingdome growes weak, without ſpirit, counſell, ſtrength, ſucceſſe, and is infinitely intangled with difficulties, internall, externall; good counſels are ſlighted or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, opportunies of doing that kingdome good not diſcerned, dangers not foreſeen, or put off without due conſideration. Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers, traytors, oppreſſors and enemies to publike good are ſet up, diviſions, ſeditions, domeſtique wars (if not forein) are made and maintained, and all things work ſtrongly to ruine; it's ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd by ſome, that there are more wars and deſolations among Chriſtians then others, and the reaſon is given, their ſinnes are greater then others, and provoke God to take away his own, and Angelicall protection, they leave the wheeles of kingdomes to men of corrupt minds, that move them wholly for private intereſts. This informs us of the honour and greatneſſe of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels that have the wheels of the world in their hands; wee look upon them as great men, which have the command of ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince or Countrey; what then are Angels, that have the rule of the whole world under God? Know, though their place be great, yet they are under command, and move not, but as they are moved by the Spirit of God: Let us alſo take heed, how we offend per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons imployed in ſuch great ſervices as they are.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That there are turnings and wheelings in all eſtates and parts of the world; the four living creatures noted the four parts of the world, and their agencies in them, and by them, now are preſented the wheels; every living creature had a wheel by it, and this ſtrongly implies that there are wheelings, turnings, and changes in all parts; yea, the very ſame that are in one part are at one time or other in another part, the wheels are alike; Are
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:123227:80"/> wars, plagues, famin in one countrey? they are or will be in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Do men die here? ſo in all parts: are men unfaithfull now? ſo they were of old; in <hi>Davids</hi> dayes hee ſaid, <hi>Men of high degree are a lie, and men of low degree vanity,</hi> Pſal. 62.9. Are there unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable times here? ſuch are abroad: are things carryed by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, oppreſſion, injuſtice here? ſo they are elſewhere: are there deſignes, plots upon our Kingdome and Church? ſo there are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on others; whatever befalls one State, befalls another, internally, and externally; the wheels are the ſame, and move alike, though ſometimes backward in one part of the world, and forward in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; there is no ſtability any where, but all things are in flux: in vain then do men travell the world to finde certainty and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in it; in vain do we tumble up and down here and there, thinking to finde ſettledneſſe, and ſomething ſatisfactory: the world is like it ſelf every where; go Eaſt, Weſt, and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a wheel, and a wheel running. <hi>Salomon</hi> had tryed all conditions; hee had wealth, wiſdome, and opportunities for he ſaith, <hi>Who ſhall come after the King?</hi> intimating, that none can travell farther then hee did, to ſearch and know the world and creatures,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 1.</note> and all conditions; and what doth hee conclude, but <hi>vanity of vanities?</hi> that is, all is extreme and ſuperlative vanity; and becauſe men will not believe it, hee doubles and trebles it, <hi>Vanity of vanities, all is vanity;</hi> take any place, or any thing in that place, it's vanity, empty, fruitleſſe, inconſtant; ſo farre from ſatisfying, that it vexeth. Hence ſome have pictured <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> upon an high hill, and all the world coming towards it, and climbing up, thinking to finde happineſſe there, but he beats them down with a rod, ſaying, <hi>It's not here, it's not here.</hi> Wee muſt not look for ſtability, content, certainty among the wheels, but above them; now its not time to look about and abroad, but to look above the world, and the wheeles of it. Chriſt hath told us what's to be had in this world; and it's certain: <hi>in the world,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>you ſhall have tribulation;</hi> and do you not finde it? ſurely now it's eminent and pungent; and hee hath told us what's to be had in himſelf: <hi>In mee you ſhall have peace;</hi> if wee have tribulation in the world, wee may have peace in Chriſt.</p>

Men bleſſe and curſe, love and hate in one day, in one hour: <hi>Amnon</hi> is ſick for <hi>Tamar</hi> till his luſt be ſatisfied, and then immediately hates her: <hi>Ahaſhuerus</hi> turns off <hi>Vaſhti,</hi> and entertains <hi>Eſther: Reuben,</hi> Gen. 49.4. unſtable as water; <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in the throne, anon in the bottome of the Sea: <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſound now, and heares by and by, <hi>Set thy houſe in order, for thou ſhalt dye; Jeruſalem</hi> beſieged, and freed in one night; in youth wee are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for pleaſure, in manhood for credit, in age for riches, as if thick clay muſt be our <hi>Viaticum</hi> for heaven.

                     <p n="2">2. Comprehenſive; a wheele in a wheele, not the gnave ſtocke in the midſt of the wheele, to which the ſpokes are faſten'd; for that hath not the forme of a wheele: but there was one wheele in another; as the orbes of the heavens comprehend one another; as in ſome Water-works, and Watches, there be wheeles one in another: and then the meaning is, that there is a ſecret hidden motion or wheele, that moves the wheeles which way ſoever they run.</p>
                     <p>Obſerve firſt, that the motions of the world, and kingdomes are perplexed and croſſe motions; like a wheele in a wheele; <hi>Saul</hi> moved with all his ſtrength to ſettle the kingdome upon his own Son; but he met with a contrary motion; <hi>David</hi> is anointed to be King, and the men of warre came to <hi>David</hi> to Hebron, to turne the kingdome of <hi>Saul</hi> to him, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.23.

                        <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> wheele was in theirs, and intangled them much in both places. What croſſe motions were in <hi>France,</hi> when the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> Prince of <hi>Condee,</hi> the Admirall, and all that were of the Religion, looked for peace, and met with a maſſacre? Are not there Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, Spaniſh, French, and Popiſh wheeles moving in our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, Armies, and Councels? Look at this inſtant upon the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this Kingdome, in Parliament, or out of it, and they are exceeding intricate; Never was skaine of ſilke or thread ſo knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or involved, as the affaires of the kingdome and world are; never bird ſo intangled in the Limetwigs or Net, as things are at this time.</p>
                     <p n="2">2.

                        <pb n="144" facs="tcp:123227:83"/>3. There is a ſecret motion which carries on the wheeles, and moves them that way they goe, there is a wheele in a wheele, and that ſets the other a moving; as a ſpring in a Watch ſets all the wheeles agoing; ſome latent engine ſtirs the wheels of the world: in ſome places you ſhall ſee the waters ſuddenly fly all about you; the cauſe of that motion is hidden; ſo in all the motions, turnes, and ſtirres of the world, there is a ſecret wheele, divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that ſets on worke and carries on. That was a great wheele and turne, when ten tribes at once fell from <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> and ran to <hi>Jeroboam;</hi> Politicians and Stateſmen could ſee ſedition, rebellion, and treaſon in that motion, the outward wheele was obvious, but the wheele in the wheele was not ſeene by every eye: <hi>Behold, I will rend the Kingdome out of Solomons hands, and give ten Tribes to thee,</hi> 1 King. 11.31. If there be diviſions, ruines, plunderings in a Kingdome, there is a wheele in thoſe wheeles, a providence that acts and orders. <hi>Job</hi> 6.5. <hi>Afflictions come not forth of the duſt, nor trouble out of the ground,</hi> they come out of the wheele, God turnes that upon Kingdomes, and families; as <hi>Micah</hi> 1.12. <hi>Evill came downe from the Lord to the gates of Jeruſalem;</hi> God hath a wheele in all the wheeling buſineſſes of the world. <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> the Emperour being inform'd of a conſpiracy againſt him and the State,<note place="margin">Zonar.</note> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Juſtinian</hi> and <hi>Juſtinus,</hi> with many others, to be executed, by a voice in the night he was bid to ſpare <hi>Juſtinian</hi> and <hi>Juſtinus,</hi> for they were to doe good ſervice, and they both afterward were Emperours: the motion of the wheele in the wheele ſav'd their lives, and advanc'd them to honour. At the Battell of <hi>Keinton</hi> was a wheele in a wheele, the wheele at firſt ran for the adverſe partie, but the wheele in the wheele turn'd it on our ſide: At <hi>Brainford,</hi> there was a wheele in a wheele. When the enemies plots have been their plagues, and their doings their undoings, the wheele in the wheele both moved and turn'd their owne workes upon them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.16.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The motions of divine providence in the things of the world, are beyond the reach of the ableſt braines. Providence walkes, works ſo darkly, deeply, changeably, wheeles about, ſo that mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls cannot tell what concluſions to make: when the iſſues of things are extant, we can ſee what the antecedent motions carried in their wombe, otherwiſe not, unleſſe wee have it by viſion; as
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:123227:83"/> here <hi>Ezekiel</hi> had; or ſome extraordinary way. Providence hath ſuch bouts and fetches, as puzzle the thoughts and hearts of the ableſt and beſt: when the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were at the borders of <hi>Canaan,</hi> they were carried backe againe to <hi>Ezion-gabor.</hi> Numb. 33. <hi>Exod.</hi> 13.18. it's ſaid, <hi>God led them about through the way of the Wilderneſſe, by the red Sea:</hi> and ſo providence leads buſineſſes about, they goe backwards and forwards, ſo that we cannot make ſenſe of Gods motions in the world; As in Characters, till a man learne, be inſtructed in them, he can make no ſenſe of them; and men now of rare abilities, cannot tell what ſenſe to make of the motions of the wheeles. Mounſieur <hi>Chaſtileon,</hi> Admirall of <hi>France,</hi> at the match of <hi>Charles</hi> the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> his Siſter with the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> was invited with the chiefe of the Proteſtants by the King to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the marriage at <hi>Paris,</hi> and to confirme Peace; the Proteſtants at <hi>Rochel</hi> adviſed him not to goe, but importunitie of others pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with him, he went and was maſſacred for it. Although he was of great wiſdome, hee could not diſcerne what way the wheeles would move; the wiſeſt man is too weake to ſpell out the meaning of the wheels, and myſteries of providence; once before he had refuſed to come to Court at the Kings ſending, who ſent Mounſieur <hi>Du Tore</hi> his couſen to advertiſe him of important af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires he had to communicate; he ſuſpecting, anſwered, the King means me no good, and tell him, there be no Count <hi>Egmonds</hi> in <hi>France;</hi> I will not ſuffer my head ſo eaſily to be cut off, as he did in <hi>Flanders. Roderick</hi> King of <hi>Spaine</hi> to aſſure himſelfe againſt the children and friends of King <hi>Vitiza,</hi> whom he had depoſed, diſmounted all the ſtrong holds, and diſarm'd the people; this ſtrengthened him againſt domeſtick enemies, not forein attempts; For the <hi>Moores</hi> invading him, ſhortly after overthrew him, and finding little reſiſtance, in ſeven or eight moneths conquer'd almoſt all <hi>Spaine.</hi> The <hi>Britains</hi> moleſted by the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> cald in the <hi>Saxons,</hi> who for ſome time ſerved them to purpoſe, but in the end conquered them and their Countrey. Theſe could not foreſee what would be the iſſue of things; the motions of providence are ſo ſecret and various, that it lyes not within the compaſſe of mans power to make certain concluſions therefrom.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. There is a connexion of cauſes and things together in the world. <hi>Hoſea</hi> 2.21, 22. <hi>I will heare the heavens, and they ſhall heare

                  <p>The commodiouſneſs of their motion for all parts, and the forme of it, are both in this 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe. The Hebrew is, In going, they went to their foure foure ſides, to the foure parts which were next to their ſides, or through the foure parts; and ſo the ſenſe is; they went to, into, or through the foure parts of the world: if you read it according to our tranſlation, <hi>upon them;</hi> the ſenſe is, when the foure living creatures moved, the wheeles moved upon their ſides; It's our phraſe, when we ask one, which ſide went he of ſuch a man? we anſwer, upon, or on his right or left ſide: but the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſenſe to me is, they went according to their foure ſides. Looke what ſide, what part of the world was appointed them, that the wheeles went to, and moved in.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And returned not]</hi> They came not backe, but went forward: There might be varietie of motions, but no backe motions, no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trogradations, being once gone forth, they returned not.</p>
                  <p>The obſervation firſt is this: That in all parts, humane things move to their appointed period, and there is no returne of them being once there. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Hoſt came to their period in the bottome of the Sea, and never ſaw <hi>Aegypt</hi> more. The Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, Prophets, Apoſtles, Martyrs, have taken up their lodgings in the duſt, and returne no more: What <hi>David</hi> ſaid of the child, <hi>I ſhall goe to it, it ſhall not returne to me;</hi> is a fit motto to all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, they muſt goe to thoſe are gone before, not they returne to
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:123227:84"/> theſe: Cities, people, families, ſilver, gold, fine linnen, they muſt ſee that corruption thoſe ſaw in former dayes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

They were ſo high, they cauſed terror, ſo full of eyes, they cauſed wonder: The Hebrew reading is ſomewhat different, it runs thus; <hi>And the rings of them, both height to them, and feare to them, or by reaſon of them;</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Propter cas.</note> the wheels were ſo high, that they bred terror, ſtruck feare into the Prophet. The word <hi>Rings</hi> in the Hebrew is <hi>Backs,</hi> their backs were high, dreadfull, that is, their Circumferences or Rings were ſo, of ſuch breadth and altitude, (for there is no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe in rings and circles) that they cauſed feare to thoſe looked upon them.</p>

                  <p>Now what is meant by this height and greatneſſe of the wheels, muſt be opened unto you; and it's this: the motions of ſecond cauſes and changes of things here in this world, are ſo great, ſo incomprehenſible by man, that they produce feares and terrors to the ſons of men; Men are troubled, that they cannot fathome the deeps, and meaſure the heighth and breadth of the wheels: when men ſee times and ſeaſons changed, kingdomes daſhed in pieces, the godly brought into bondage, the wicked advanced, truth perſecuted, errours in credit, juſtice troden down, and all things moving by contrary motions; they ſtand amazed, and not able to reach the cauſes of things, to meaſure the wheels, and ſee into the exact motions of them, they become ſenſible of their own weakneſſe, and ſay, O the heighth of the wheels! O the ſhallowneſſe of our ſpirits!</p>

                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 1. That the cauſes and motions, and changes in the world, are unknown to the ſons of men; the wheels are too high for them to meaſure; man is ſo beetleliſh and purblind, that the dim ſight of his ſoul pierceth not into the ſecrets and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of cauſes,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 3.11.</note> it only comes at the out-ſide and extremities of things, the ſuperficies of the wheel, but not the heighth and depth of it, not the true nature and cauſes of things; ſo that admiration, opinion, not ſcience is begotten in man; this <hi>Agrippa</hi> knew, that writ a Book of the vanity of Sciences: and <hi>Zanche,</hi> that writ a Tractat, <hi>Quod nihil ſcitur;</hi> and <hi>Socrates</hi> was judged the learned man, ſo that hee ſaid, This I know, that I know nothing;<note place="margin">

                     </note> and there be ſuch heighths that none of the Prophets nor Apoſtles have been able to meaſure; I will give you an inſtance in two or three: <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.1, 2. <hi>Righteous art thou, O Lord, yet let me talk with thee of thy judgements: wherefore doth the way of the wicked proſper? wherefore are all they happy that deal very trecherouſly? Jeremiah</hi> a great Prophet is puzled at this heighth of the wheel; <hi>Thou haſt planted them, yea, they have taken root: they grow, yea, they bring forth fruit, thou art neere in their mouth, and far from their reines: Job</hi> is at a ſtand in this caſe, <hi>Chapt.</hi> 12.7. <hi>Wherefore do the wicked live, become old; yea, and are mighty in power?</hi> God puts <hi>Job</hi> to it in the 38, 39, 40, 41. <hi>Chap.</hi> So <hi>Aſaph,</hi> Pſal. 73. and <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.3. were troubled at the proſperity of the wicked, and could not take the altitude of the wheels in their dayes; Nature nor Grace could do it. If <hi>Solomon</hi> knew not the way of an Eagle in the aire, of a Serpent upon the rock, of a ſhip in the midſt of the Sea, of a man with a maid, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.19. how ſhall we know the motions of the wheels in the world?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the conſideration of the unſearchableneſſe of Gods wayes, ſhould beget feare and trembling in us; the wheels had a heighth and dreadfulneſſe upon that heighth: When a man comes to the ſea ſhoare, beholds the vaſtneſſe and ſtrange motion of it, and findes hee is puzled, feare creeps upon him from the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the greatneſſe and Majeſty of God, who ſits upon the floods, and commands the deeps: ſo here, when wee thinke of the wheels, how high they are, that wee cannot ſearch out the cauſe of their motions, this way or that way, our ſouls ſhould tremble at the Majeſty of that God which ſets ſuch mighty wheels awork: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.6. <hi>Thy judgements are a great deep;</hi> mens ſins are a great deep, and Satans wayes are called a depth; but Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, his wayes in the wheels are the greateſt deep of all, they are unſearchable.</p>
                  <p>That Chriſtian kingdomes are ſhaken in pieces with wars, when Heathen kingdomes are ſpared; that there is ſuch unequall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of the means of grace in the world; that the greateſt part are without the knowledge of God and Chriſt to this day; that many able men are laid by, or caſt into corners, where are

                  <p>The next thing in the Verſe to be touched, is the eyes in theſe rings.</p>
                  <div type="part">
                     <head>And the rings were full of eyes round about them four, <hi>or,</hi> on every ſide to them four.</head>
                     <p>Every wheel had eyes: they were <hi>ſtellatae oculis,</hi> bedeckt with eyes, as the heaven with ſtars; there were eyes within, and eyes without, and not a few, but many; every ring, every wheel was full of eyes.</p>
                     <p>By eyes, we are to underſtand the active and infinite providence of God, which runs through all things, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.9. <hi>The eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth;</hi> that is, divine providence is active every where.</p>
                     <p>The Scripture by eyes, referring to God, intends: firſt, his knowledge and notice of things, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.3. <hi>The eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evill and the good:</hi> ſecondly, his care, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.15. <hi>The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous;</hi> that is, hee careth for them: thirdly, his direction, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.8. <hi>I will guide thee with mine eye;</hi> and theſe eyes note out Gods inſpection, care and ordering the wheels in all their motions, and that in all quarters. The rings were full of eyes, and whatever the thoughts of men were, they moved according to direction of divine providence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 1. That how ever the wheels and motions of them be too high for men, and dreadfull unto them, yet they are not ſo to God; hee ſees into all the wheels, they have eyes on every ſide, God knowes them throughly, their eſſences, qualities, operations;
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:123227:86"/> we cannot pry into the ſtate of Kingdomes, Councels, Armies, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; there be as ſecrets of States,<note place="margin">Arcana impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, &amp; arcana rotarum.</note> ſo ſecrets of wheels in thoſe States, which none know but God, and God knowes them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly: let wheels be never ſo great, terrible, move never ſuch ſtrange and croſſe wayes; as Kings, Armies, Parliaments are great wheels, and have unknown motions; yet they are ſubject to the Lords eyes, he ſees into all their ſecrets, and ſees more in their motions then they themſelves.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The motions of the wheels are conſiderable and judicious, they are not carryed on blindly; how ever they ſeem to be carried,<note place="margin">Non caeco im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petu volvun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur rotae.</note> yet they are carryed by reaſon and counſell; there be eyes in the wheels; when men do things raſhly, injudiciouſly, we ſay; Have you no eyes in your head? here be eyes in the rings, and they move not caſually. Thoſe motions in the world, that ſeeme moſt confuſed, are compoſed and ordered motions: Are rich men made poor; honourable men baſe? are conquerers made captives? do ſervants ride, and Princes go on foot? are the wicked oppreſſors in the ſeats of juſtice? are the godly beneath, and the vile above? are the counſels of Jeſuits, forainers, and deſperate malignants en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained, and others rejected? are there civil wars in a Land, great plundering, ſpoyling of Miniſters, Chriſtians, Parliament men themſelves? theſe things are not done without conſiderate and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious motions of the wheels: <hi>Acts</hi> 4.27, 28. When <hi>Herod, Pilate, Gentiles, Jewes,</hi> were gathered together againſt Chriſt, were not the motions then, (though inhumane, bloody, and murtherous) conſiderate, and providentiall motions? The Text ſaith, <hi>They did whatſoever the hand and counſell of the Lord determined before to be done;</hi> it was no blinde buſineſſe, the wheels of it were full of eyes, and moved by the motions of heaven. Gods owne eye, heart, and head were in it. And now, when the <hi>Herods, Pilates,</hi> and <hi>Malignants</hi> of the world do ſtir againſt Chriſt and his members, the wheels move conſiderately.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The motions of the rings, wheels, and all ſecond cauſes, are certain, arriving at the end appointed. They are full of eyes, which direct them to their journeyes end, ſo that they miſſe not the marke they aime at. What if many ſecond cauſes be ignorant, blind, know not their own motions; yet if they have guides in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible to lead them, it's ſufficient to conduct them to the intended
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:123227:87"/> end. If a ſeeing dog can lead a blind begger from place to place, direct his motion to the deſired end; ſhall not the eye of providence lead any, all ſecond cauſes to their end? Providence is an uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thing, and diſappoints not God of his expectation. The Pilot carries a great ſhip from harbour to harbour, over the Seas, through the ſtormes, and fulfils the mind of the Maſter; and ſo Providence carries the great wheels up and down, to the very place appointed.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The leaſt motions of the wheels are not without providence; ſome think that the great things in kingdomes and the world, are tranſacted by providence, but for they leſſer they paſſe in a caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all manner, providence reaches them not; but the eyes were eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where, the wheels were full of eyes; not a few eyes, here and there one, but in every part, that ſo mans minde might be freed from ſuch ſiniſter thoughts, as that there ſhould be any motion of any wheel without the direction and influence of providence. God hath made the leaſt and greateſt creatures, and hee cauſeth the leaſt and greateſt motions.<note place="margin">Providentia i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta cura<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> omnia, ut unum ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid, ita ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula, ut ſi illud curaret uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum, <hi>Auguſt in Confeſſ: And the Schoolmen ſay, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence is</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finita in omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, infinita in ſingulis.</note> Let us pitch our thoughts upon ſome leſſer motion, the diſpenſation of a lot, the fall of a haire from the head, the preparations of the heart, the anſwer of the tongue, theſe are all of the Lord, and directed by providence; the earth loſeth not a pile of graſſe; the trees not a leafe; the water not a fiſh; the aire not a bird, without an ordinance of providence.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Providence orders the motion of the rings and wheels in all parts, all the world over; not one, two, or three wheels had eyes, but all foure had eyes round about them: God by his divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence ordered things as well in <hi>Babylon</hi> as in <hi>Sion;</hi> Providence wrought in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and in the red Sea. As there are wheels in all parts of the world, in all Kingdomes of the earth; ſo there are eyes in all thoſe wheels.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The works of God in diſpoſing and governing ſecond cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, are admirable, glorious, and beautifull workes: The wheels were full of eyes, fitly diſpoſed, wiſely carried on, certainly attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ends. Could we ſee the eyes in the wheels, we ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fault the workes of God in the world, but ſtand and admire their glory and beauty; when the heavens are vailed with clouds, we have ſowre and diſcontented thoughts of the heavens them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but when the clouds are gone, that we can ſee the Starres, thoſe eyes of heaven, then we admire their beauty and glory; and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:123227:87"/> certainly, it's a moſt glorious ſight to ſee the heavens full of ſtarres in a cleare night; and it's no leſſe glorious to ſee the eyes in the wheels, and the choice acts of providence in all their turnings and windings: <hi>Cauſſin</hi> ſaith, the world in all its parts is ruled like a paper with muſick lines, and if wee could ſee thoſe lines, they would be as glorious as lines of gold.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The motions of the wheels are ſuch as that they hold out a providence to all; there is ſomething in the wheels that none can reach, and ſomething that any may ſee, they are full of eyes, and the weakeſt may ſee one providence or other; if not all the eyes, yet ſome of them; there be myſteries in the wheels to exerciſe the greateſt, and eyes to ſatisfie the weakeſt: As no man but ſees the ſtars in the heaven at one time or other; ſo no man but may ſee the eyes in the wheels. That evill doth not over-run all, and the wicked devour the good, argues a providence. In one of the <hi>Conanie</hi> Iſlands, <hi>Johannes Metellus</hi> ſaith, there is a tree which drops water at every leafe, and ſufficeth the Inhabitants and their flocks, being a drie Iſland without water. <hi>Mithridates,</hi> when in his cradle, had his clothes conſumed with lightning, and his body not toucht: A father and a ſon ſhipwrackt at ſea, the ſon ſail'd to ſhoar upon the back of his dead father. In theſe particulars and ſuch like provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence doth eminently appeare.</p>

                  <p>THe motion was forwards, upwards and downwards: and for the time of their motion and ſtation, it was when the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures moved or ſtood: as the Cherubims moved, ſo moved the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:123227:88"/> wheels, forward, upward, downward; and when they ſtood ſtill, the wheels ſtood. The kind and manner of their motions, with their reſt, depended on the living creatures; they moved equally at their motion. What's meant by the lifting up of the wheels muſt be inquired; for Angels to be lifted up is not ſtrange, they are heavenly creatures, and heaven is their habitation. But for the wheels to be lifted up, that is very ſtrange, wee muſt ſearch out the ſenſe; for into heaven they were not lifted. Expoſiters leave us in the dark, all except one that I have met with paſſe over this difficulty; and what I find in that one is this: the lifting up of the Angels and the wheels, referre to the ſupreme cauſe, and ſeems to tell us, that inferiour and ſuperiour cauſes, wheels and Angels are under the regiment of the firſt cauſe; and if wee take the words actively, as <hi>Montanus</hi> doth render them, <hi>viz.</hi> the living creatures in lifting up themſelves from the earth, the wheels lift up themſelves alſo; and that is, they looked up to heaven for directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and aſſiſtance, which may well be called a lifting up themſelves, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.1. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the Lord do I lift up my ſoul;</hi> that is, to thee do I look for counſel, comfort, ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>If wee take the words paſſively, when the living creatures are lift up from the earth, the wheels were lift up, then I will give you my thoughts what the ſenſe may be, and it's this: the lifting up is not meant of lifting up to heaven, but to ſervice: when God ſhould more then in an ordinary way let out himſelf to the Angels, give them new light, new ſtrength, and ſo lift them up to great ſervice, then the wheels alſo were lifted up proportionably to do their parts; and the words in the Text invite me to conceive it to be the ſenſe; becauſe it's ſaid, <hi>The ſpirit of the living creatures was in the wheels;</hi> when God by his Spirit lifted up the Angels to great imploiments, then that Spirit lifted up the wheels, the ſecond cauſes to more then ordinary ſervice: and the word lifting up, notes ſervice, a higher degree of it then before: 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19.4. <hi>Lift up thy prayer for the remnant that are left. Hezekiah</hi> ſends to <hi>Iſaiah</hi> when <hi>Rabſhakeh</hi> blaſphemed, and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was beſieged, and ſaith, <hi>Iſaiah! thou art a Prophet, and haſt more then an ordinary meaſure of the Spirit, lift up thy prayer, let it be extraordinary, ſuch as may lift up the ſpirits of all to joyn with thee, higher then ever, ſuch as may lift up Jeruſalem out of miſery.</hi> So <hi>Jehoiaehin,</hi> when he
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:123227:88"/> was ſet up upon the throne to governe and to do great ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, it's ſaid, <hi>his head was lifted up,</hi> Jer. 52. and ſo in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12.10. the lifting up of Gods hand notes doing of ſome great matter.</p>
                  <p>The next thing inquirable into, is the ſtanding of the living creatures and the wheels, when the one ſtood, the other ſtood; do the Angels ſtand ſtill at any time? they are active ſpirits, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in motion. Two things this ſtanding implies:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A ceſſation from any ſervice in hand, at the will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God, if he would call off the Angels from their imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments before they were finiſhed. In this ſenſe the Angels are ſaid to ſtand, and ſo the ſecond cauſes they uſed, although they were both imployed in ſome other ſervice: or,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When they had perfected any work in hand, then they were ſaid to ſtand, not idle, but in expectation of a new Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; like faithfull ſervants, when their work is done, preſent themſelves before their Maſter, and demand their pleaſure; ſo the Angels, and ſecond cauſes, hearken what God will ſay more, and what is the next word and work to be done, they wait upon God for new inſtructions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 1. The motions of this inferiour world, and the ſecond cauſes in it, do depend upon higher cauſes, even heavenly motions, the miniſtery of Angels: The obſervation is plain from the words, <hi>When the living creatures went, the wheels went by them.</hi> If the Angels move, the wheels move alſo: they are great things the Angels have in their hands; the wheels of Nature, of States and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, yea, of the Church it ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Nothing in the world is caſuall; many things ſeem ſo to us, but in <hi>veritate rei</hi> are not ſo; all things here below move at the motions of others; and that which is ordered by the motion of Angels or God himſelf, cannot be caſuall. The wheels are moved by Angels, Angels by God himſelf. God directs all; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing happens, falls out amongſt us, wherein the hand of God or Angels is not; things are not accidentall: if a thing could drop from the heavens, or be done on earth without God and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, that were caſuall and accidentall indeed. And becauſe men ſee not the immediate or remote cauſes of things, who they be move the wheels on earth, therefore they attribute effects, events and accidentall things to fortune, chance, luck, to good, to bad
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:123227:89"/> dayes and hours, which proclaims mens ignorance and forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of God,<note place="margin">Qui paratis menſam for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunae, Hier. Qui ponitis menſam for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunae, <hi>Vulg.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Auſtin</hi> miſſes his way, and ſo eſcapes the danger of death was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended: another being in a deſpairing humour, ſeeks a knife, a halter to undo himſelf, and findes a great treaſure: a third hath his ring drops off his finger into the Sea, and after finds it in the bowels of a fiſh. God ſo directs all theſe accidentall things, that there is nothing done but by a ſecret inſtinct and hint from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,<note place="margin">Abſconditum quid?</note> and in all ſuch paſſages we ſhould mind ſomething of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That nothing can let the motion of the wheels when Angels and Providence would have them ſtir. When the living creatures moved, the wheels went preſently; it's not in the power of ſecond cauſes, of men or devils, to hinder the work of God in the hand of Angels. The King of <hi>Perſia</hi> may withſtand <hi>Gabriel</hi> 21. dayes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <hi>Dan.</hi> 10.13. but the wheels moved all the time, <hi>Gabriel</hi> prevailed, and Gods work proſpered in his hand: wicked men make head againſt God, Providence, Angels, and think to ſtop the wheels when they move not on their ſide, but all is in vain; if a man ſhould catch hold of a Chariot, running to ſtop or turn the courſe of it, were it not folly or madneſſe in him? and becauſe he would be the Chariots <hi>remora,</hi> that may prove his ruin: ſo here, men and devils do ruine themſelves in oppoſing the wheels, which notwithſtanding all oppoſitions, proceed and keep their courſe. And let me tel you a riddle, Gods works go on through the hearts, heads and hands of his greateſt enemies, Providence fetches them in, and makes them ſubſervient to the worke; they oil the wheels, although they know it not, and forward the work, though againſt their wils. God in this kind makes uſe of kine and cart, men and devils, yea, any creature to carry his Ark to its place.</p>

That ſecond cauſes move not of themſelves, neither ſuperior, nor inferior; not the wheels which are weaker here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, nor the Angels which are ſtronger and above, they move not, but at the motion of the Spirit; whither that was to go they went: Earth, Water, Winds, Beaſts, Fowles, Men, their Councels, Warres, Peace, Trades, they all move <hi>ad motum Spiritus,</hi> it's the Spirit of God that moves all the wheels. All motions, all wheels are ſubject to the Spirit, and regulated by it. When the Devill ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, tempted, ſmote <hi>Job,</hi> he and all his motions were ordered by a higher power; So when the Devils entered into the ſwine, they did what, and moved whither the Spirit would have them to do, to goe.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. The motions of the wheels are not unſeaſonable; when the living creatures went, then the wheels went, and what is the cauſe of their motion; the Spirit was in the wheels, and the Spirit was in the living creatures: if we condemne their motions and changes as untimely, we ſhall queſtion and condemne the work and wiſdome of the Spirit, which is infinitely wiſe and incontrollable in all its operations: men, even the beſt of them, are apt to fault the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the wheels, and to cenſure the acts of Providence as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable; the counſell is not good at this time that <hi>Achitophel</hi> hath given, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.7. Did the Spirit then move that wheel ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably? yes, becauſe the counſell, though not good for <hi>David,</hi> whoſe deſtruction it tended unto, yet it was good for the ruine of <hi>Achitophel</hi> and <hi>Abſolom,</hi> and that was the intent of the Spirit in moving that wheel, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 14. <hi>The Lord had appointed to defeat the good counſel of Achitophel, to the intent to bring evill upon Abſalom,</hi> and <hi>Achitophel</hi> too. What? civill wars in <hi>England,</hi> when <hi>Ireland</hi> lies a bleeding to death; when ſuch a time to vindicate the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and wrongs ſuſtained at the hands of the Emperor; when ſuch a time to help the Proteſtants in <hi>France;</hi> what, now to have King and Parliament divided? now to be imbroyled in a bloody, civill war, is not this moſt unſeaſonable? Stay thy thoughts and cenſures, O vain man; The Spirit of God is a Spirit of wiſdome, and knowes when it is beſt to move the wheels. No Muſician tunes it better then the Spirit of God, had theſe changes and motions been, and our enemies abroad at peace, they would have taken the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of our diviſions and wars, and made a prey of us; ſeeing therfore we muſt be let blood, or die, this great and wiſe Phyſician, the Spirit in the wheels hath done it ſeaſonably: Are great towns plundered? Counties diſturbed? Families impoveriſhed? or, Churches diſſolved? the righteous ſmitten; the wicked ſpared? and kingdomes ſhaken into pieces? theſe motions, changes, are not unſeaſonable; they are all in their appointed time: this war is in it's
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:123227:92"/> appointed time, <hi>Ezra</hi> 4.17. <hi>There is mention of peace, and at ſuch time,</hi> the time is obſerved; ſo now, the war, and at ſuch a time, ſuch a time as is appointed, as the Spirit of God judges fitteſt. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 3.8. <hi>There is a time of war and a time of peace,</hi> verſ. 3. <hi>a time to kill, and a time to heal, a time to break down, and a time to build up;</hi> the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit knowes and obſerves thoſe times punctually, and moves not a wheel but in its due time, and ſo the motions of all are beautifull in Gods eye, and ſhould be free from mans blame; <hi>man knowes not his time,</hi> Eccleſ. 9.12. But it's not ſo with the Spirit, it knows times and ſeaſons, and never miſſes to move the wheels in their due ſeaſon. The travell of a woman at nine moneths is not more ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable then the turning of the wheels at what time the Spirit pleaſeth: If the tree, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. bring forth her fruit in due ſeaſon, and the Spirit moves the wheels in due ſeaſon, none are too early, none too late.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The conſent w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is between heaven and earth; the Angels and wheels is from the Spirit of God which moves in them. When the living creatures went the wheels went, when they ſtood, theſe ſtood, when they were lifted up, theſe were lifted up; and what's the ground of this harmony? the Spirit was in them, that acted them, and ordered their motions; having the ſame Spirit, they went the ſame way, and did the ſame work without difference, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions; The Spirit of God is a Spirit of union, where that moves it moves not to diſcord, but to minde the ſame things, and to move the ſame wayes: <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.16, 17.

That the wheeles readily do the will of God, and follow the Spirit, where ever it goes, thither their ſpirit was to go, the Spirit was in the motion; and therefore they are ſaid to have eyes, and the Spirit in them, and to move at the motion of the Spirit; wheels have roundneſſe, and ſo readineſſe to move, but not Gods way, full of eyes they are, and looke at Gods ends; but if they had not the Spirit in them, they would not move that way, or if they did, it would not be without diſpute, ſloth, murmuring; it's the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit makes them move the right way, and readily in that way; where the Spirit is in any, there the motion is right and ready; Ayre, Sea, Land, have no vigour in them, but what the Spirit puts in, and they move as the Spirit will have them: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148.8. <hi>Fire and haile, ſnow and vapour, ſtormy wind, fulfilling his word,</hi> they all do the will of God, fulfill his word readily; they have the vigour of Gods Spirit in them: <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.2. <hi>The Spirit moved upon the face of the waters,</hi> not an Angel, not the wind, but the eternall Spirit of God, and ſo they move by vertue of the Spirit into their place, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit createth, cheriſheth and ſuſtains all things; and they are all obedient to the call of the Spirit, and tread in the paths of it, all creatures move after the Spirit: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.30. <hi>Thou ſendeſt forth thy Spirit; they are created, and thou reneweſt the face of the earth;</hi> Herbs, Plants, Trees, Beaſts, Fowls, all living creatures are created and formed by the Spirit, and move according to thoſe principles, and inſtincts the Spirit puts into them, their motions and ſervices are no other then what the Spirit leads them unto, and thoſe motions they readily performe.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The wheels and ſecond cauſes do go on and move inceſſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, unweariably, in the way the Spirit puts them, they went whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Spirit went; neither the Spirit nor the wheels do faint or fail in their motions.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The Spirit of God is a living and lively Spirit, a Spirit of livelineſſe, it's the Spirit of the living God. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5.

There be admirable qualities, inſtincts and excellent operations in Plants, Birds, Beaſts, what ever they be, it's the Spirit that wrought them there; the Spirit is in the wheels, the inſtincts in the Bees and Birds to build ſo curiouſly; in the Locuſts, to go out by bands; in the Ants, to gather their meat in Summer; in the Conneys, to make their houſes in the rocks; in the Spider, to weave ſo fine a web, is put in by the Spirit of God. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.6. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord will come upon thee, and thou ſhalt propheſie, and be turned into another man;</hi> that is, thou ſhalt have gifts fit for government; the Spirit wil inſtruct and inable thee to rule this people.</p>
                  <p>The conſideration of this point ſhould be a ſtay to our ſpirits, which way ſoever the wheels move, the Spirit of God is in them; When we look abroad, behold the croſſe and confuſed motions of the world, our hearts repine, murmure, ſink in us, ſhift, and wee are ready to ſtart aſide out of our places to unwarrantable practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; but let us remember the Spirit of God is in the wheels, and ſtirs them at its owne pleaſure; If <hi>Shimei</hi> curſe, <hi>David</hi> ſees, God in that motion, and ſaith, <hi>Let him alone, God hath bid him:</hi> ſo <hi>Job,</hi>

                  <p>It ſhould alſo help our faith, becauſe in all deſignes of men, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the wheels, God hath his deſigne going on; the Spirit is in the wheels, which is an inviſible, but a ſtrong agent, and doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible work, carrie on the Lords deſigne, how ever the motions of the wheels ſeem to us; let the wheel be intangled, run, ſtand ſtill, or move contrary wayes, yet Gods work goes on, and our faith ſhould get up.</p>

They are ready to exerciſe the will and pleaſure of Chriſt, this farther advances the honour of Chriſt; their wings were ſtretched out, and they willing to move in any ſervice, if their Lord gave out the word: when the <hi>Centurions</hi> ſervants were ſo willing to go and come at his bidding, it made much for his honour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.9. ready, cheerly, active ſervants are an eaſe and honour to their Maſters: unreadineſſe and unwillingneſſe in

                  <p n="4">4. They are unanimous in their Miniſtrations, they fall not out by the way, their wings are ſtreight the one towards the other, they cary on the work put into their hands with love, ſweet agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, peace and conſtant.

                  <p n="5">5. They reverence the greatneſſe and Majeſty of Chriſt; though they be high and glorious, yet they ſee ſo vaſt a diſtance between Chriſt and themſelves, that they cover their faces, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. and their bodies here, they come not into his preſence rudely, but with great reſpect and reverence. As God is to be had in reverence of all that are about him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.7. ſo Chriſt is reverenced by all the Angels that are about him. Women are to be vail'd in the aſſemblies, becauſe of the Angels, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.10. to ſhew their reverence and ſubjection to them being preſent; and Angels are covered, to ſhew their reverence and ſubjection unto Chriſt; it's an honour to the Angels, that in reverence to them the women are to be vail'd; and it's a great honour to Chriſt, that Angels reverence and adore him.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They are carefull to prevent all offence in their miniſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, either of God or man, of Chriſt or any creature; they cover up their bodies, their feet, that nothing obſcene may be ſeen and give diſtaſte, nothing excellent be ſeen, and draw to an over-valuing and Idolizing of them; ſo wiſe and cautious they are; and this addes much to the glory of Chriſt, that his ſervants the Angels, never give advantage to men or devils, to reproach their Lord and Maſter. Alas, how much doth Chriſt ſuffer by us, even by Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and others in their miniſtrations? Men ſee our weakneſſe, our pride, our vain-glory, miſcarriages many wayes, and rejoyce
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:123227:97"/> in our fleſh, even when Chriſt is reproached. But Angels paſſe through all their imployments, ſo that they are blameleſſe, and Chriſt made beautifull, whom they ſerve.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. That Angels are furniſhed for their miniſtrations; they have wings to flie, and wings to cover their bodies, what ever may make them and their ſervices acceptable, ſpeedy, ſucceſsfull, they have it; and this is for the honour of Chriſt, thoſe he imployes in his work hee inables and accommodates, they go not forth empty, unqualified; he ſent Apoſtles, and fill'd them with his Spirit, hee gives gifts to men, and wings to Angels.</p>

                  <p>HEre is a farther deſcription of the Angels, by their going, their noyſe, their ſtanding, and letting down their wings. The principall is the noyſe of their wings; and that I ſhall make moſt inquiry into. A difficulty incounters us in the beginning of the Verſe, <hi>when they went, I heard the noyſe of their wings;</hi> rather when they did fly was the noyſe of their wings, then when they went. The originall will help us ſomething in this ſtrait; it's otherwiſe there: thus the words are read, <hi>And I heard the noyſe of their wings, like the noyſe of great waters; as the voyce of the Almighty when they went;</hi> ſo that there the originall brings it in, and ſo wee may take it thus; <hi>the noyſe of their flying was as the noyſe of great waters, and the noyſe of their going, as the voyce of the Almighty;</hi> or, rather thus: by going we may underſtand their motion, the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of their office, and that made a great noyſe, which is am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified and ſet out by divers ſimilitudes.</p>
                  <p>The firſt ſimilitude is of <hi>great waters:</hi> waters that run among the ſtony and rocky mountains, make a terrible noyſe, gulling into the earth, and threatning the foundations of the mountains; hence <hi>Job</hi> 14.19. the waters are ſaid to weare the ſtones, they eat into them, making concaves and chambers therein; and for their noyſe
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:123227:97"/> in the 46. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> v. 3. there it's no gentle murmuring, but a roring; the Sea roares, ſo that it's heard in ſome places many miles.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond ſimiltude is, as <hi>the voyce of the Almighty,</hi> or, <hi>the voyce of God:</hi> ſome underſtand hereby, <hi>a great voyce,</hi> becauſe it's the uſuall dialect of the Hebrew tongue, to expreſſe great things, by ſaying, they are things of God; as <hi>Cedars</hi> of God, for tall and great ones, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80.10, 11. Rivers of God, for great rivers, and full of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.10. Mountains of God, for high ones, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.6. ſo a trembling of God, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.15. for a very great trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling: and in like propriety of ſpeech, <hi>the voyce of the Almighty,</hi> for a great voyce; ſome truth in this may be granted, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more then a great voyce in generall is to be looked at,<note place="margin">Pſal. 18.13.</note> it being a Viſion, and Hieroglyphicall things preſented to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet therein, we muſt therefore refer it to that in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 29. even <hi>the thunder,</hi> which is called the voyce of the Lord, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. <hi>The voyce of the Lord is powerfull, the voyce of the Lord is full of Majeſty; it breaks the Cedars, yea, the Cedars of Lebanon;</hi> and ſo to that <hi>Pſ.</hi> 18.13.</p>
                  <p>The third Similitude, is <hi>the voyce of ſpeech:</hi> ſome myſtery lies in this, that their noyſe ſhould be like an articulate voyce, the ſpeech of man. And two things may be intended in it; either the ſpeech of man that is upon ſome terrible deſigne, and ſo ſpeaks grievous words, even words of death, and ſo it holds analogie with the other ſimilitude of <hi>Waters,</hi> and of <hi>Thunder;</hi> or elſe by <hi>voyce of ſpeech,</hi> the noyſe of their wings, the judgements they executed did ſpeak and proclaime Gods commands, his wrath, and the peoples ſins; if the judgements ſeemed terrible, as they were indeed; the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down of a kingdome, the ruine of the chiefeſt City and people in world; the voyce of ſpeech was, God commands, God is angry; you are guilty, and we muſt proceed.</p>
                  <p>The 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and laſt ſimilitude, is, <hi>as the noyſe of an hoſt,</hi> this is a dreadfull noiſe; there is beating of Drums, ſound of Trumpets, clattering of Armour, jumping of Chariots, rattling of wheels, neighing, ſtamping, prauncing and ruſhing of Horſes, the roaring of Cannons, the clamors of men wounded, groanes of men dying: Carry me out of the Hoſt, <hi>for I am wounded,</hi> ſaith <hi>Ahab:</hi> O the dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full complaints that are there, ſuch as would aſtoniſh a man of ſpirit to heare; the noyſe of the Angels was ſuch a noyſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 1. That the judgements of God executed upon king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:123227:98"/> cities, perſons, are very dreadfull: they are like roarings of the Sea, when great ſtorms be, and mighty Navies are daſhed in pieces, and ſunk into the deeps; they are formidable as the noyſe of an Army, marching or fighting. How dreadfull were the plagues of <hi>Egypt?</hi> that in <hi>Exod.</hi> 9.23, 24. when hail, thunder, and fire were mingled together, was very grievous, ſuch as never was; the burning of <hi>Sodome</hi> was dreadfull, yet <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> judgement was ſorer, <hi>Lam.</hi> 4.6. all their pleaſant things were ſpoyled, women and maids raviſhed in the ſtreets; their mighty men troden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der feet; young men and virgins cruſhed, troden down as grapes in the Wine-preſſe; Prieſts and Elders dyed for famine, children ſwooned in the ſtreets, powred out their ſouls in their mothers boſomes for want of bread and water, pitifull women ſod their children of a ſpan long, and made meals of them; they were ſlain in the Sanctuary, terrors were round about, and no way to eſcape left; if they looked for comfort, there was none to give it; Princes were hanged up by the hands, thoſe did weare ſcarlet, imbraced dung-hils, Sabbaths; Sanctuary, Law, Viſion, all failed, prevailing fire was in their bones, death they longed for, and found it not, God was againſt them, their enemies proſpered, and mockt at them and their Sabbaths: Where's your God? what's become of all your worſhip, ſacrifice, prayers, faſtings? they clapt their hands, hiſſed, wagged their heads, and ſaid of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Is this the perfection of beauty, the joy of the whole earth? this is the day that we looked for; Theſe expreſſions you have in the Book of <hi>Lamentations. David,</hi> a King, a Prophet, a man of a warlike ſpirit, that feared not the <hi>Bear,</hi> the <hi>Lion, Goliah,</hi> ſaith, <hi>my fleſh trembleth for feare of thee, I am afraid of thy judgements,</hi> Pſal. 119.120. When other things did not daunt him at all, Gods judgements did; there was daunting terror in them and no marvell, there is wrath in them, ſuch rage, wrath, fury, as is in wild beaſts: <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5.14. <hi>I will be unto Ephraim as a Lion, and as a young Lion to the Houſe of Judah: I, even I will teare and go away, I will take away, and none ſhall reſcue;</hi> ſuch terror as is in an earthquake, that ſhakes the foundations of all: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.6. ſuch as in a ſtrong winde, and an overflowing ſhowre: <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.13. ſuch as in a flail that beats out the corn, and breaks the ſtraw in pices: <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.12. ſuch as in the Sea or Earth ſwallowing up; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 21.9.

It cries to us for righteouſneſſe, <hi>when Gods judgements are in the earth, the Inhabitants of the world will learne righteouſneſſe,</hi> Iſa. 26.9. They cannot learne unleſſe they be taught; and do they not teach, and teach many leſſons to feare God, whom men have forgotten in their proſperity, to make reſtitution to men whom they have wronged in the day of their <hi>wills;</hi> to be charitable in cenſuring others, and rigide in cenſuring themſelves?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Angels are not only ſwift, but efficacious in their motions, and adminiſtrations: The great waters, mighty thunders and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous armies make way before them, and nothing can withſtand their force; and ſo it is with Angels when they are upon ſervice, none can ſtand before them; they deſtroy armies, ſhake kingdoms, move all the wheels in the quarters of the world, and their moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are not faint, but forcible.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It's not every eare that heares the noyſe of Angels wings, though their noyſe be great, efficacious, like waters, thunder, the voyce of ſpeech, as an hoſt, yet all heare them not; it's the Prophet heares them, and ſuch as have divine ſpirits: the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Angels are unperceiveable to moſt of the world; all eyes

The words of wiſe men are heart in quiet ſpirits, well compoſed mindes: when there are great winds and tempeſts, wee heare not others ſpeaking; when the wind blowes in the ſoul, and there is a tempeſt, wee cannot heare God ſpeaking; <hi>Job</hi> 4.16. <hi>There was ſilence, and I heard a voyce,</hi> then God ſpake when the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence was; he delights in a calme and meek ſpirit, that is of great price with him, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.4. when ſpirits are in ſuch a frame, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtred from the world, free from diſtempers, God loves to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate hmſelf to them: in the night oft God appeared unto our fore-fathers, becauſe then they were in a manner out of the world,

When <hi>John</hi> was in <hi>Patmos,</hi> he heard Chriſts voyce; when <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was by the river ſide, hee ſaw heaven opened, and heard a voyce from above; that in <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.12. <hi>The voyce of the Turtle is heard in our Land,</hi> it's ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, the Turtle ſings not in Winter, when the winds and ſtormes are, but when it's Spring and Summer, all quiet and ſerene, then her voyce is heard: So Chriſts voyce is heard when Winter is over, when the tumults and ſtirs are laid.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As this voyce referres to <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> it affords this inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: That there muſt be a voyce from above, before wee are fit to heare or do any ſervice for God; There be no prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, qualifications in men by vertue of man, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe is not fitted for to preach the Word unto this captive people, till hee heare Chriſts voyce.

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:123227:102"/> Chriſt hath oft appeared in Viſion like unto man, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.13. <hi>I ſaw in the night Viſions, and behold one like the Sonne of man;</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> acknowledging this to be meant of Meſſiah: ſo in <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.13. <hi>one like the Sonne of man appeared in the midſt of the ſeven Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks,</hi> and <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.14. <hi>I looked, had behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one ſate like unto the Sonne of man.</hi> By theſe places we have good warrant to conceive, that it was Chriſt that did appear unto <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in this Viſion.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. It was a prefiguration of his incarnation, that in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſe of time his Divine nature ſhould aſſume our fleſh into the unity of his perſon.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That according to his humane nature, hee ſhould ſit upon the Throne of God, and judge the ſonnes of men: hee was <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrator Patris,</hi> the great <hi>Agent</hi> of his Father.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. That man is not capable of immediate acceſſe to, and converſe with God: Here be many ſteps and degrees before the Prophet comes to ſee Chriſt, and then it's not in his Divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but in the appearance of a man. Here be the living creatures in the way by the firmament over their heads, and then a Throne, and that of Saphirine colour, and afterward a ſight of Chriſt in the form of a man, and then converſe. If the Lord ſhould not condeſcend to our weakneſſe, and mantle up his Majeſty, there could be no communion between him and us.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the Lord Chriſt, who appeared like man, hath King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Majeſty: Here is a Throne, and a Throne ſet before him.

Hee makes <hi>Jeruſalem a burthenſome ſtone to all that meddle with it,</hi> Zach. 12.3. There is mention made in the 28. of our Prophet, 14. of ſtones of fire; Chriſt is the ſtone of fire that breaks and burnes the kingdomes of the earth; many kingdomes in <hi>Europe</hi> are on
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:123227:107"/> fire at this day, and almoſt broken in pieces, and burnt to aſhes: we may ſee that Chriſt is terrible in his judgements, hee is riding now upon his red horſe, taking peace from the earth; dipping his garments in blood, and cauſing his great ſword to eat fleſh and drink blood; he is upon his black horſe, bringing in famine and peſtilence; the pale horſe is ſadled, and death is on the back of him, and intends to ride through our Cities, Countryes, Townes, Families, and make a great ſlaughter, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.6. and will yet be more terrible, verſ. 17. the great day of his wrath is at hand, and who ſhall be able to ſtand? neither Kings, great men, Captains, mighty ones, nor any other ſort can do it; they will call on rocks and mountains to fall upon them, and hide them from the face of him that ſits on the Throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb; his eyes ſparkled with fire, his feet are like burning braſſe, and out of his mouth iſſue flames of fire; and to ſet out the dreadfulneſſe of this Judge, <hi>Paul</hi> tels us, he ſhall come in <hi>flames of fire,</hi> 2 Theſ. 1.8.

That he is zealous in ſentencing and puniſhing Malefactors, he is <hi>pruna ſumme ignita,</hi> and not only ſo, but here is a fire within, zeal in his breaſt, a ſpirit of burning within; you may ſee the zeal of Chriſt in <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.14, 15, 16, 17. The Temple being a type of Chriſt, and by divine appointment ſet apart for worſhip, ſhould not have been made a place of merchandize, but Chriſt coming and finding in the Temple thoſe that ſold Oxen, Sheep, Doves, and changers of money ſitting, made a ſcourge of ſmall cords, and whipt them out of the Temple like a company of Rogues, drove out the Sheep and Oxen, powred out the changers money, overthrew the tables, bid them take away their Doves, and not make his Fathers Houſe an houſe of merchandize; they might have ſaid, All theſe are brought for ſacrificing, for publique ſervice and the worſhip of God; and what doſt thou pretend Gods glory, and take away his ſacrifice? we will whip thee out of the Temple, and uſe thee as an enemy to God and his worſhip: and it was a wonder they did not, Chriſt being a poore man, having no countenance from the Rulers, and medling with rude fellowes, and dealing with them
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:123227:108"/> ſo ſharply and ſhamefully, as to whip them out: it was wonder they tore him not in pieces, or ſtoned him to death for it; Chriſts zeal was hot, and carried him on to puniſh and diſgrace thoſe delinquents, not fearing their rage or malice, ſo Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry might be repaired. This zeal in Chriſt was ſo intenſe, that it warmed the hearts of his Diſciples, who upon it, remembred what was writ of him; <hi>The zeal of thine houſe hath eaten mee up.</hi> How zealous was Chriſt in his carriage towards the <hi>Aſian</hi> churches? he tels <hi>Epheſus,</hi> that except ſhee repent, recover her firſt love, and do her fitſt works, <hi>hee will come quickly, remove her Candleſtick out of its place,</hi> and unchurch her, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.5.

                  <p>But I come to the words of our Prophet; here is <hi>a Bow in a cloud in the day of rain,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Qui infra lumbos imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis apparebat <hi>Maldon. A lapid.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſome make the brightneſſe here to be that which is downwards from his loynes, and to be like unto the Bow in the cloud, and ſo they exclude all the parts from his loynes upward, from having reference to this Bow, underſtanding by his upper parts, the divine nature, by his lower the humane; and ſomething there is in it, becauſe the Text ſaith, in 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe: <hi>I ſaw from the appearance of his loynes downwards, as the appearance of fire, and it had brightneſſe round about it.</hi> That fire had not the other: but it ſeems to mee more ſuitable to the Text and truth, that this brightneſſe being in circuit round about it, did compaſſe, not the lower parts only, but the whole Throne and Perſon of Chriſt; and ſo wee finde in <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.3. where Chriſt is upon the Throne, that there is a Rain-bow round about it, and therefore conceive that here alſo the Rain-bow was round about the Throne.</p>
                  <p>We will not ſtand upon that longer, but come to ſee what the Bow points at: And,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is an Embleme of glory, Gods glory is much ſeen in the heavens alwayes; but when the Bow is ſet in the cloud, <hi>Habet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſionem aliquam non ſpernendam, ac ſi Deus adderet aliquid ad nudum Coeli aſpectum, Cal.</hi> It's a glorious creature, and hath glorious co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours in it, various, and yet beautifull, affecting the eye for the preſent, more then all the glory of the heavens beſides; and I finde among Interpreters, that it ſignifies,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the glory and beauty of divine Providence in its various proceedings with the wicked and the godly, it puniſheth the one, it rewards the other; and when theſe are done, there is ſo much glory in it, that Angels and men are affected with it.</p>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:123227:111"/>
                  <p>Secondly, the glory which is conveyed and communicated to the creatures; for in the heavens the glory of God doth ſhine. You know the Rain-bowes originall and being is from the beams of the Sun, communicated, received, and reflected, and though it be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, yet it's a borrowed glory, and ſo informs us, that the glory in all creatures is from another, from Chriſt, <hi>By him Kings raigne, He gives gifts to the ſonnes of men, He enlightens every man that comes into the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is a token of mercy and favour;<note place="margin">Symbolum cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentiae, gratiae &amp; miſericor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diae.</note> it's a Bow without ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, the back (ſaith <hi>Ramban</hi>) of it being towards the heavens, and ends downward, it's a ſigne of mercy; for when one ſhooteth arrowes, hee holds the back from him. And that it is a ſigne of grace and mercy, we will make out by Scripture unto you: that covenant made by <hi>Noah</hi> about the waters in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.8, 9, 10. is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the Covenant of Grace, ſtriken with man in Chriſt; <hi>In a little wrath,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>I hid my face from thee for a moment, but with everlaſting kindneſſe will I have mercy on thee; for this is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s the waters of Noah unto mee: for as I have ſworne that the waters of Noah ſhould no more go over the earth, ſo have I ſworne I would not be wroth with thee: for the mountains ſhall depart, and the hils be removed, but my kindneſſe ſhall not depart from thee, neither ſhall the covenant of my peace be removed, ſaith the Lord, that hath mercy on thee.</hi> Here you ſee the Covenant of waters applyed to the Covenant of grace; and in the <hi>Revelation</hi> you ſhall ſee the ſame ſigne, even the Rain-bow applied for a ſigne of grace, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.3. There is Chriſt ſitting upon the Throne, and a Rain-bow round about it, which ſhewes, that the Throne of Chriſt is compaſſed about with mercy: and <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.1. <hi>A Rain-bow was upon his head;</hi> Chriſt is preſented in Viſions, crowned with the Rain-bow, as a meſſenger of grace and peace;<note place="margin">Iſa. 9.6.</note> for hee is the Prince of peace, and his Crown is the Rain-bow, a certain Embleme of peace, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.13, 14. The Rain-bow hath va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of colours, and all glorious, and ſo doth the more fitly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the mercies of Chriſt, which are various and glorious.</p>
                  <p>This brightneſſe then in the figure of a Rain-bow, ſignifies grace and mercy, held out to thoſe that were godly, or ſhould repent of their wickedneſſe; the brightneſſe before noted the glory of his judicary proceeding, and here being form'd into a Bowe, it betokens mercy.</p>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:123227:112"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 1. That mercy and grace come to us through the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature of Chriſt, from thence goeth out the brightneſſe and the beams that make the Bow; when the Word was made fleſh, then went out glory, <hi>John</hi> 1.14. and <hi>grace,</hi> Verſ. 16. Then was <hi>Sol in nube,</hi> the moſt glorious Rain-bow that ever was or ſhall be in the world; he was not a ſigne of peace, but our <hi>Peace,</hi> Epheſ. 2.14. By his blood we are brought nigh, for <hi>he is our peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. God hath his dayes of Rain: When the flood was, then there was rain to purpoſe forty dayes together; If God hath rained <hi>bread,</hi> Exod. 16. he hath rain'd <hi>wrath,</hi> Job 20.23. <hi>ſnares, ſtorms, fire, brimſtone,</hi> Pſal. 11.

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the Lord Chriſt in wrath remembers mercy, he mingles mercy with judgement; hee ſits as Judge upon the Throne; hee pronounces ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

When the great deluge of water was drowning the world; yet <hi>Noah</hi> and his were ſaved, there was mercy in the midſt of judgement: and here is a Judge with a Rain-bow over his head, to aſſure the godly, they ſhould not periſh in this flood of wrath, now powring out upon the <hi>Jews. Jerome</hi> ſaith of the Bowe, it is a ſign of mercy, and the covenant which God made with man, that when it appeared in the cloud, we might know we ſhould not periſh by a flood; and much more when Chriſt ſits in judgement with the Rain-bow about him, may the godly know, that they ſhall not periſh by the wrath of God; if the glory of his Majeſty, ſtatelineſſe of his Throne, terror of his Juſtice, and the greatneſſe of his Power do at any time diſcourage us, wee muſt looke at the Rain-bow round about him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member his Throne is compaſſed with mercy. It's ſaid of the <hi>Jews,</hi> when they ſee the Rain-bow, they go forth, confeſſe their ſins, but will not look upon it. Confeſſion of ſins, or any duty what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, will do us no good, unleſſe wee look upon the Bowe; the mercy of Chriſt, <hi>now</hi> was a ſtorm, and in it a Rain-bowe, for the Prophet, and godly to looke at, it's ſaid in the Text the Bowe
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:123227:112"/> in the cloud in the day of rain, then it's a rainy day when God rains ſnares, fire and brimſtone, and horrible tempeſt upon the wicked, even then the bow is in the cloud, and the righteous ſhould look for it, and look to it; they ſhould remember the covenant and mercy of it: Is it not a rainy and ſtormy time now? is not this great Prince angry with the kings and kingdomes of the earth? doth he not frown, chide, and ſmite, and that with dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtrokes in many places? Let us look at the Rainbow now, and know, if there ſhould come an overflowing ſcourge, a deluge of wrath upon the world, yet the <hi>Noahs</hi> ſhall be arked and ſafe, the righteous ſhall be hid, Chriſt will manifeſt mercy to them. Saith <hi>John,</hi> Rev. 4.2. <hi>I was in the Spirit, and behold, a Throne was ſet in heaven, and there was a Rain-bow round about the Throne;</hi> no ſooner was <hi>John</hi> in the Spirit, but he ſaw the Throne and the Rain-bow; let us now be in the Spirit, look with eyes of faith, and wee ſhall ſee the Throne, him ſits on it, and the bow round about him; and then, though kingdomes lie under the floods of errors, ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ungodlineſſe, though drown'd in troubles and blood, yet wee ſhall ſee God and Chriſt in a way of love and mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us.</p>

                        <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 1. That all the glory is ſeen of God in this life any wayes, is but the appearance and likeneſſe of the glory of God. There was much and great glory in this viſion, there is more in the world in the creatures, more in the Church, and yet all this is only a ſhadow, and a ſmall appearance of the glory of God. If we ſhould ſee ten thouſand Torches lighted up in a dark night, they make a glorious light; yet are they nothing to the light of the Sun, when that comes, torch-light, ſtar-light, ſeem appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of light, rather then light it ſelf: So when the glory of God ſhall be revealed, it will darken all other glory; and there was not ſo great a difference between the light in <hi>Goſhen,</hi> and darkneſſe in <hi>Egypt,</hi> as there will be between the glory of God and that glory now appeares in the world. The glory of God is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expreſſible or comprehenſible by any or all the creatures. The glory that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaw on the earth, and that <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſaw in the heavens, did not expreſſe the thouſand part of this glory; and neither heaven not earth are able to comprehend the ſame.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. See the infinite goodneſſe of the Lord, that will expoſe that to the eyes of his ſervants, which is ſo deare unto him; his own glory. Precious things of Princes and great ones, are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon for the view of all, but choyce friends, favorites ſhall ſee them. God hath nothing more precious then his glory; yet this ſhall his choyce friends and favourites ſee; and becauſe they cannot ſee it in the perfection of it, God will draw a picture of it with his own hand, and hold forth to the eyes of his here: <hi>Ezekiel</hi> had an appearance of the glory of the Lord, but it's the greater mercy, that God will put forth creating power in a viſion, and preſent the likeneſſe of his glory in variety of things, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the capacity, and for the advantage of his ſervants: ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaw the glory of the Lord in the Mount; ſo Chriſt ſhewed unto <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> his glory in his transfigura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> hee had a glorious viſion, Chap. 6. and ſo glorious it was, that it's called the glory of the Lord; and this did the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſee in the likeneſſe and appearance of it, not in its own nature, for no man you ever could ſo ſee the glory of God and live.</p>

                     <p>Here is the firſt effect of it, when hee had this viſion, beheld this glory, hee was amazed, ſo ſmitten with the luſtre of it, that hee could ſtand no longer, but down hee falls, and that upon his face. There is frequent mention in Scripture, that upon viſions, and appearances of Divine Majeſty the ſervants of God have falne down, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.17. <hi>He fell upon his face,</hi> and <hi>Saul, Acts</hi> 9.4. <hi>hee fell to the earth, Abraham</hi> hee fell on his face when God appeared to him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.3. The three Diſciples Chriſt took up into the mount, when they ſaw the glory, and heard the voyce, they fell on their faces. There is a great difference between falling on the face, and falling on the back. To fall forward, notes reſpect and humility, but to fall backward is a note of ſin and guilt: <hi>Abraham</hi> fell twice upon his face; the Prophets oft; the godly,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:123227:116"/> when they are to deale with God, fall forwards, the wicked backward,<note place="margin">Cadere in faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em, obſervan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae eſt, &amp; hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militatem ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per olet; ſed retro cadere peccatum ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponit, aut in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicat, <hi>Jer.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>There be divers reaſons or grounds of mens falling upon their faces, in viſions and apparitions of God.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Majeſty of God that is preſent in theſe viſions, and ſome way or other repreſented to thoſe that have the Viſions: ſo <hi>Dan.</hi> 10.9.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The luſtre of Divine glory that accompanies the ſame; this made <hi>Paul</hi> and his company fall to the ground, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.13, 14.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Some new and dreadfull thing that appeares in the Viſion as here; creatures with four faces, and four wings, wheels, rings, full of eyes, and ſo high, that they are dreadfull.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Senſe of their owne frailty and weakneſſe; Viſions having divine Majeſty, Glory, and ſome terribleneſſe in them, have wrought ſtrange effects upon infirme men; they have lockt up their ſenſes, and put them in a deep ſleep, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.18.10. <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. made them ſick and faint many dayes, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.27. much grieved and troubled their ſpirits, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.15. taken away their ſtrength and comelineſſe, <hi>Dan.</hi> 10.8. ſmitten dumb, <hi>Dan.</hi> 10.15. breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, <hi>verſe</hi> 17.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. To teſtifie two things: firſt, thankfulneſſe for ſome mercy received or promiſed; upon this ground <hi>Abraham</hi> fell on his face, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.23. when God appeared to him, and told him, that hee would make a covenant with him, and multiply him exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>hee fell on his face,</hi> to manifeſt, as his humility, ſo eſpecially the gratefull frame of his ſpirit towards God for ſuch a mercy.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Reverence, worſhip and reſpect unto divine Majeſty; falling upon the face notes ſo much in the language of <hi>Canaan,</hi> 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 20.18. <hi>Jehoſaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground, and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jeruſalem fell before the Lord and worſhiped him:</hi> ſo bowing in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.9. is to note reverence and worſhip, <hi>They that dwell in the wilderneſſe ſhall bow before him, and his enemies ſhall lick the duſt;</hi> they ſhall come in to Chriſt, and by bowing their faces to the ground, and licking the duſt of his feet, ſhall teſtifie their reverence and ſubjection unto him, ſo <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.23.</p>

                     <p>That which made our Prophet fall down on his face here, was feare and amazement at the apprehenſion of the Majeſty of Chriſt, the great glory that appeared, newneſſe and dreadfulneſſe of things in the Viſion.</p>

They are weake eyes that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not indure the Sun-beams; they more weake that cannot indure the light which is more remote from the brightneſſe and glory of the Sun; and ſo here, man cannot indure the glory of the Lord, nor the likeneſſe of it, nor the appearance of the likeneſſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That the ſight of glory is an humbling thing; when the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſaw the appearance of the glory of the Lord, hee falls upon his face, then hee is conſcious of his own weakneſſe and worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſſe, then hee trembles, and ſees the great diſproportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Majeſty and nothingneſſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.5. <hi>The glory of the Lord ſhall be revealed, and all fleſh ſhall ſee it;</hi> and then followes, <hi>all fleſh is graſſe;</hi> glory will convince us that wee are but graſſe; it's not hearing will do it, at leaſt, not ſo effectually: ſeeing, and ſeeing of glory doth humble mightily, ſeeing of miſerie cauſeth grief, <hi>mine eye affecteth mine heart;</hi> but ſeeing of glory cauſeth godly ſorrow, <hi>Job</hi> 42.5, 6. <hi>Now mine eyes ſeeth thee,</hi>

                     <p>Secondly, for the doctrine of Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.27. <hi>My ſheep heare my voyce,</hi> that is, my Doctrine; they do not hear Chriſt immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſpeaking, but they heare his Goſpel, his Miniſters opening it unto them.</p>

                  <p>It's Chriſt who ſpeakes, and unto <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> whom hee calls <hi>the Son of man;</hi> the originall is, <hi>the ſonne of Adam,</hi> that is; of earthly man: for, as the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.47. <hi>The firſt Adam was of the earth earthly,</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> ſignifies earth, or red earth, whereof his body was made; and when we read in Scripture this phraſe, it notes out to us,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Our baſe beginning, that we are of the earth; there is no man, be he never ſo excellent, high, wiſe, honourable, but hee is the ſon of <hi>Adam, terrae filius,</hi> a brat of the earth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.2. <hi>Both low and high, Adam</hi> and <hi>Iſh:</hi> the baſe man and the noble man, as the <hi>Chaldee</hi> renders it; both the ſons of <hi>Adam,</hi> and the ſons of <hi>Jacob</hi> are ſo, they have all one father, and all one mother, and that is the earth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Our frailty, that wee are earthen veſſels and ſoon broken in pieces; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.20. <hi>Put them in feare, O Lord, that the nations may know themſelves to be but men,</hi> they think themſelves gods, but ſhew them thy power, thine iron Rod and Scepter, bring a War, a plague, a Famine amongſt them, and then they will know that they are frail weak men.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Our worthleſneſſe and fitneſſe to be rejected, who amongſt us regards a clod of the earth, an earthen veſſell, ſilver or golden ones, ſome prize, and prize too much, but earthly ones are contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible; Nations are as the <hi>drops of the bucket,</hi> and <hi>ſmall duſt of the ballance,</hi> Iſa. 40. and are not they contemptible things? this made <hi>David</hi> to wonder, and ſay, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144.3. <hi>Lord, what is man, that thou takeſt knowledge of him? or the ſon of man,</hi> the ſon of earth, <hi>that thou makeſt account of him, that thou viſiteſt him?</hi> Pſal. 8.4. and <hi>Job</hi> 7.17. <hi>What is man, that thou ſhouldeſt magnifie him; and that thou ſhouldeſt ſet thine heart upon him?</hi> theſe be high and great expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to be beſtowed upon ſo poor a thing as man is, to take know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him; and ſuch knowledge, as to make account of him, as
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:123227:119"/> to minde him, viſit him, magnifie him, to ſet the heart upon him, this is exceeding much from an infinite, great and glorious God towards worthleſſe men, and not credible, if the Spirit of God had not revealed it.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. To prevent pride, ſay ſome Expoſiters: hee had a glorious Viſion, was among Angels, ſaw the Lord Chriſt, and was to enter upon the Propheticall Function, the leaſt of which might ſtir cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and make pride bloſſome; when <hi>Paul</hi> had his rapture in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the third heavens, and heard things unutterable, what ſaith he, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. <hi>Leſt I ſhould be exalted above meaſure, through the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of revelation; there was given to mee a thorne in the fleſh, the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger of Satan to buffet me, &amp;c. Paul</hi> was in danger of being lifted up, but God prevented it; and ſo here, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> is minded of his mean originall, his frailty, worthleſneſſe and end, that he might not be exalted with his Viſion or Office; we are exceeding apt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the receit of great mercies, to grow proud and confident, which are evill in any, but worſt in a Prophet; and therfore, to prevent theſe, hee calls him <hi>Son of man.</hi>

                        <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 1. That the Lord Chriſt is full of bowels and comſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſions, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was fallen down upon his face, the glory of the Viſion, and greatneſſe of him that ſate upon the Throne had conquered and fell'd this our Prophet to the earth, and there hee lay as a man wounded, and without ſtrength, but Chriſt leaves him not in this condition, but ſpeaks, and that kindly to him: <hi>Son of man, ſtand upon thy feet;</hi> he is affected with his infirmity, ſenſible of his fears and troubles: the man that fell among thieves, going from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Jericho,</hi> being plundred and wounded, found no pity from the Prieſt and Levite, but much from the good <hi>Samaritane,</hi> when he ſaw him, hee had compaſſion on him, he went to him, bound up his wounds, put in oyle and wine, ſet him upon his own beaſt, was content to go on foot by him, brought him to an Inn, and took care of him, and paid for his cure, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.33, 34, 35. This <hi>Samaritane</hi> was Chriſt, who pitied <hi>Adam,</hi> and in him man-kinde, that went from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the ſtate of perfection, to <hi>Jericho,</hi> a ſtate of change; for, as <hi>Chemnit.</hi> obſerves, <hi>Jericho</hi> ſignifies the Moon, and ſo a changeable condition; the <hi>Prieſt</hi> and <hi>Levite</hi> notes the Law, with all its additaments, they paſſed by, and never reached or healed the wounded ſoul of man, but Chriſt the <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titane,</hi> with the grace of the Goſpel, and blood of the Covenant, with that oyle and wine, cured man, brought him upon his own ſhoulders to the Church, to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> again, and there took care for him; we have not a legall high Prieſt which is without bowels, and can do little for us, but we have an Euangelicall high Prieſt, full of bowells and mercy, ſuch an one as is touched with our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,

That thoſe are humble and ſmitten down with ſenſe of their own vileneſſe, weakneſſe or worthleſneſſe, through the ſight of glory, and greatneſſe, Chriſt quickly raiſes to comfort again: our Prophet was down in the end of the former Chapter, and in the beginning of this he is up again. The humbling from the ſight of God, his glory, and greatneſſe, is the moſt effectuall humbling, and the moſt ſpeedy, effectuall and ſweeteſt comfort doth follow it. <hi>Job,</hi> after he had ſeen God, and humbled himſelf; thereupon his captivity is turned, his comforts multiplied, <hi>Job</hi> 24.5, 6.10.12. So <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> being humbled upon the ſight of glory, preſently a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphim comforts him, touches his lips with a coal from the Altar, and ſaith, <hi>Thine iniquity is taken away, and thy ſin is purged: Daniel</hi> was humbled for his own ſins, the ſins of his forefathers, and the afflictions of the Church, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. and the Lord ſent <hi>Gabriel</hi> to comfort him, who told him, <hi>hee was a man greatly beloved,</hi> and that <hi>he came to give him skill and underſtanding,</hi> verſe 22.23. God doth not humble and throw down his to leave them, but reaches out a hand to raiſe them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That man carries about him principles of humiliation; he is the Son of man, the ſon of the earth. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 31.3. The <hi>Egyptians</hi> are men, and not God, <hi>Adam velo el,</hi> they are weak and worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe things, and ſo are not only <hi>Egyptians,</hi> but <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> all men, and ſo have no cauſe to be puffed up at all, but great cauſe to be humbled: <hi>Job</hi> call'd <hi>corruption his father, and the worm his mother, Job</hi> 17.14. you ſee what ſtock and kindred <hi>Job</hi> came of, and wee are all of the ſame houſe, therefore afterward in the 25. <hi>Chap.</hi> v. 6.

                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. That the command of Chriſt is powerfull; <hi>Stand upon thy feet,</hi> ſaith hee, and it proved efficacious; let Chriſt ſpeak, and the thing is done, <hi>By him were all things made,</hi> Joh. 1.3. hee ſaid, <hi>Let there be light, and there was light,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>Let there be an earth, and let it bring forth, an it was ſo;</hi> hee call'd forth things that were not, and gave them a being; under the Goſpel, how power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full were his commands: he bade devils depart the poſſeſſed, and they did ſo; he bade the winds and waves be ſtill, and they were ſo; he called <hi>Lazarus</hi> out of the grave, and he came forth preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: there is infinite power in Chriſt, and great, yea, oft exceeding great vertue goes forth with his commands: he ſaid to the Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that were ſtrangers to him, <hi>Follow mee, and they left all, and followed him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. That the Lord loves to incourage man to his duty; hee ſaith not here, <hi>ſtand upon thy feet</hi> only, which might have ſufficed, but he makes him a promiſe; <hi>and I will ſpeak with thee,</hi> I that am upon the Throne, compaſſed with glory, that have the rule of all the world in my hand, I will ſpeak with thee; here was ſingular incouragement to this duty, and ſo to other duties; it's mans du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to walk uprighty, and to incourage unto it; the Word ſaith, <hi>No good thing will be with-hold from them that walk uprightly,</hi> Pſa. 84.11. It's our duty to believe, and did not Chriſt tell <hi>Martha</hi> in a particular caſe, that if ſhe would believe, ſhee ſhould ſee the glory of God, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11.40. And told he not another, that all things are poſſible to him that believeth? <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.23.

                  <p>THe Prophet being confirmed by the word of Chriſt in the foregoing verſe, here he is comforted and confirmed by the Spirit alſo. What is meant by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> muſt be opened; ſome have conceived, that when our Prophet fell upon his face at the ſight of him and his glory that ſate upon the Throne, his ſpirit left him, and hee lay for dead, and ſo here by <hi>Spirit,</hi> to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood his ſoul, or ſpirit, returned, entred, revived him, and ſet him upon his feet; but this interpretation wee cannot admit for three Reaſons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We never reade that ever any were ſtricken dead when God appeared unto them in Viſions; the utmoſt wee finde is that of <hi>Daniel, Chap.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 17. <hi>Neither was there breath left in me,</hi> through feare, he was as a man out of breath, but not without a ſoul, hee had a deadly feare, but was not dead.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Text it ſelf confutes that opinion; for, in the laſt words of the former <hi>Chapter</hi> it's ſaid, <hi>I heard a voyce of one that ſpake;</hi> if <hi>Ezekiel</hi> had been ſpiritleſſe, ſouleleſſe, when hee fell upon his face, it had been impoſſible for him to have heard a voyce.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Had it been the return of his own ſpirit, the words would not have been, <hi>he ſet me upon my feet,</hi> but I aroſe; we muſt therefore leave that interpretation.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="217" facs="tcp:123227:123"/>2. By <hi>Spirit,</hi> ſome underſtand an Angel, and their reaſon for it, is becauſe it's ſaid, <hi>He ſet me upon my feet;</hi> the Prophet being among Angels, and they ſeeing him down, one lifted him up, and ſet him upon his feet; but this interpretation, although it be <hi>Piſcators,</hi> I cannot commend unto you: for,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, how could any of theſe Angels that had faces, bodies, wings and feet, enter into the Prophet? for here it's ſaid, <hi>The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit entred into mee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, if it had been an Angel, the words muſt have run thus, rather then as they do; one of the <hi>Spirits,</hi> one of the <hi>Angels</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into me, and not the <hi>Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By <hi>Spirit</hi> then underſtand, that Spirit which was in the living creatures, and in the wheels, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Even the eternall Spirit of God;</hi> and of this judgement is <hi>Jerome, Gregory, Calvin, Junius, Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donate, &amp;c.</hi> If their teſtimonies ſuffice not, take the teſtimony of Scripture, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.24. <hi>Then the Spirit entred into mee, and ſet me upon my feet, and ſpake with mee, and ſaid, Go, ſhut thy ſelf within thy houſe, &amp;c.</hi> Here the Prophet repeating the ſame words, ſheweth, that it was the Spirit of God he ſpake of, and neither Angel, nor his own ſpirit. The meaning is this; when Chriſt ſpake unto me, and I heard his voyce, preſently I felt divine vertue, <hi>the Spirit</hi> ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon, <hi>entred into mee,</hi> comforted and confirmed me, ſet me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my feet, and fitted mee to heare the voyce of that glorious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſate upon the Throne.</p>

                  <p>Theſe all ſeem to imply the moving of the Spirit from one place to another; but the Spirit of God is infinite in eſſence, filling heaven and earth, and changes not place; the thing aimed at in them, is:</p>

                  <p n="3">3. Impletion.

But for the phraſe here, <hi>The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit entred into mee,</hi> a like one is in <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Rottenneſſe entred into my bones,</hi> that is, it came not <hi>ab extra,</hi> but there was a diſpoſition and principle in him before to rottenneſſe; but now it wrought, it manifeſted it ſelf, and filled him with it: ſo here, the Spirit was in the Prophet before, but now there was a more lively operation and manifeſtation of it: yea, farther, this entrance of Spirit, notes out his filling with the Spirit, it poſſeſſed him fully, there was abundance of the Spirit in him, to fit him for, and confirm him in his Propheticall Function. <hi>The Spirit entred into him,</hi> took him up, and ſingled him out for divine ſervice.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:123227:124"/> the great and ſolid Comforter, to raiſe, confirme and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That thoſe the Lord Chriſt intends to ſet up for Officers in his Church, he gives his <hi>Spirit</hi> unto, the <hi>Spirit</hi> enters into <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> before he is called, he is filled with the <hi>Spirit,</hi> the gifts and graces of it. When Officers of an inferiour nature were to be made in the Apoſtles dayes, even officers to ſerve tables, what men muſt be looked out? men of honeſt report, full of the Holy Ghoſt and Wiſdome, they muſt be ſuch as the Holy Ghoſt hath entred into and filled, elſe they were unfit for that ſervice, <hi>Act.</hi> 6.3. much more then ſhould they be fill'd with the <hi>Spirit,</hi> that are for the higheſt place in the Church of God, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.17. <hi>Saul</hi> was fill'd with the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.24. it's ſaid of <hi>Barnabas,</hi> hee was full of the Holy Ghoſt, the <hi>Spirit</hi> entred into them and they preached, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.2. They muſt be ſeparated for the work whereunto the Lord had call'd them, even for the chief places in the Church of God; the Offices in the Church, are for men that have the Spirit of Chriſt in them, in ſome fulneſſe of it; thoſe places are not for others, ſuch as are fill'd with wine, with the world, with a ſpirit of envie, error, contention, and Antichriſtianiſme, but have not the Spirit of Chriſt in them: the falſe and lying Prophets had no entrance of the <hi>Spirit</hi> into them, and therefore the Lord ſaith, he ſent them not, <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.14. They flattered themſelves they were call'd and ſent of God, and had the <hi>Spirit,</hi> as <hi>Zedekiah</hi> ſaid to <hi>Micaiah, Which way went the Spirit from mee to thee?</hi> 1 King. 22.24. but they neither had it, nor were ſent of God, but ran, and were not ſent, <hi>Ier.</hi> 23.21. And unleſſe men have the <hi>Spirit</hi> enter into them, they are neither fit for that Function, nor ſatisfyingly know they are call'd to it; many among us are called of men, that were never call'd of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That man by his naturall abilities cannot reach or receive the things of God: <hi>Ezekiel</hi> muſt have the <hi>Spirit</hi> enter into him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee can heare or underſtand any thing to purpoſe: reaſon and diſcourſe is not more above the capacity of a Beaſt, then the things of Chriſt and his <hi>Spirit</hi> are above the capacity of man, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. <hi>The naturall man receives not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſſe unto him;</hi> the preaching of the Goſpel and Chriſt crucified, was a ſtumbling-block to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:123227:125"/> fooliſhneſſe to the <hi>Greekes;</hi> the <hi>Iewes</hi> were skill'd in the Law, and the <hi>Greeks</hi> in Philoſophy; and neither of them entertain Chriſt or his Goſpel, their knowledge and abilities ſerved them to take of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence at Chriſt, and to condemn the Goſpel for fooliſhneſſe; and it's not all that naturall abilities do, not only not reach the things of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> but they cannot do it, neither can hee know them, ſaith the Text; for they are ſpiritually diſcerned. Tell a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man, that God hath begotten a Son, that God is man, that a Virgin hath brought forth, that God hath purchaſed a Church by his blood, that men are reconciled unto God, and juſtified by the death of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Verba audit, ſpiritualem ſenſum non aſſequitur.</note> they are riddles unto him; ſuch truths are like a ſealed book, the ſpirit and life of them he is incapable of; tell him that a man muſt deny himſelf, mourn for his ſins, walk in the Spirit, believe in another for ſalvation, and theſe things are fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe unto him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That the Word without the <hi>Spirit</hi> is inefficacious, when hee pake, the <hi>Spirit</hi> entred, had not there been entrance of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> the Word had not prevail'd, the Prophet had not been raiſed; the Word is of little moment and power, unleſſe the efficacy of the <hi>Spirit</hi> be in it, if it be not quickned by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> it is a dead letter. Many thouſands heare the Word, who are fallen by <hi>Adams</hi> and their own ſin, but they are not ſet upon their feet, as our Prophet was, and the principall reaſon is, the <hi>Spirit</hi> enters not into them, it may ſtand and knock at the door, but hath not entrance, and therefore they are not lifted up out of their unbelief, and other corruptions; they are not removed from the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to <hi>Canaan,</hi> from the ſtate of nature, to the ſtate of grace: when therefore you finde ſuch expreſſions in Scripture, as that the Word is, <hi>incoruptible ſeed,</hi> 1 Pet, 1.23. <hi>a burning fire,</hi> Jer. 20.9. <hi>the power of God to ſalvation,</hi> Rom. 1.16. <hi>the Word of life,</hi> Phil. 2.16. that it's quick, powerfull, ſharper then any two edged ſword, piercing, to the dividing aſunder of the ſoul and ſpirit, &amp;c. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4. that it is <hi>converting the ſoul,</hi> Pſal. 19.7. <hi>the grace of God that brings ſalvation,</hi> Tit. 2.11. Theſe, and ſuch like phraſes, you muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, not excluſively, as if the word were, and did ſo without the <hi>Spirit,</hi> but conjunctively, when the <hi>Spirit</hi> enters together with the Word, then it is ſo; the efficacy is not in <hi>ſonitu ipſo,</hi> but proceeds <hi>ab arcano Spiritus inſtinctu,</hi> all the vertue and operation is
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:123227:125"/> in the power of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> neither is the Word uſeleſſe, it's the Medium by which the <hi>Spirit</hi> works. God is the Father of Lights, yet is not the Son uſeleſſe, by it he enlightens us.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That the Word is the Chariot of the <hi>Spirit:</hi> when he ſpake,<note place="margin">Joh. 7.37, 38, 39. Acts 10.44, 45, 46,</note> the <hi>Spirit</hi> entred into mee, together with the Word of Chriſt went the <hi>Spirit;</hi> that is <hi>vehiculum ſpiritus,</hi> Joh. 20.22. Chriſt breathed upon them, and that breath conveyed the Holy Ghoſt unto the Diſciples; ſo it's the Word that carries the <hi>Spirit</hi> to men: by the diſpenſation of the Word, the <hi>Spirit is conveyed</hi> to our ſouls; hence the Goſpel is call'd <hi>the miniſtration of the Spirit,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.8. and the Miniſters of the Goſpel, <hi>the Miniſters of the Spirit,</hi> verſ. 6. The Law which was from Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> the Apoſtle calls a dead, a killing letter; but the Goſpel which came out of Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> he calls the <hi>Spirit,</hi> or miniſtration of it; and therefore more fully in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.2. he ſaith, <hi>Received yee the Spirit by the works of the Law, or by hearing of faith?</hi> not by the works of the Law, that was the miniſtration of death, but by the Goſpel, that was <hi>the miniſtration of the Spirit:</hi> ſo that the word of Chriſt tranſports the <hi>Spirit</hi> over to the hearts of thoſe that believe; and if ſearch ſhould be made, whether the <hi>Spirit</hi> do alwayes accompany the Word of Chriſt, preached unto the ſons of men, ſome inferiour degrees and works of it may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to go along with the Word: <hi>Act.</hi> 7.51. <hi>Yee ſtiff-necked and uncircumciſed in heart and eares, yee do alwayes reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4. <hi>They were made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> there was ſomething of the <hi>Spirit</hi> in the Word, when it was preached unto theſe two ſorts of Hearers, the one reſiſted the <hi>Spirit,</hi> in the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, the other received the common gifts of it; ſome weak ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the <hi>Spirit</hi> may be yeelded alwayes, to attend the Word, but effectuall and powerfull do not; the beams of the Sun are oblique and direct; where oblique, they produce weak effects, where direct, ſtrong ones, and ſo the operations of the <hi>Spirit</hi> are oblique towards all reprobates, and the work is ineffectuall on them, but direct upon the Elect, and ſo ſtrong, efficacious, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Our Word came not to you in word only, but alſo in power, and in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Chap. 2. v. 13. it wrought effectually in them.</p>

                  <p n="7">7. It is the Spirit of God that inables to diſcerne the things of God, and aſſures our ſpirits of the truth and reality of them; the <hi>Spirit</hi> entred into the Prophet, ſet him upon his feet, that hee heard him that ſpake unto him; now having the <hi>Spirit,</hi> hee was fitted to heare Chriſt, inabled to judge of what hee ſpake, to ſatisfie his ſoul concerning the truth, reality and excellency of his Doctrine, <hi>Job.</hi> 10.27. <hi>My ſheepe heare my voyce, and a ſtranger will they not follow;</hi> Verſe 5. they can diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the voyce of Chriſt, and all others; and how come they to do it? they are Sheep, not Goats, not Wolves, not Foxes; and how come they to be Sheep?

Chriſt is inveſted with all power, and therefore ſends Officers to all nations; <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11. He gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Euangeliſts, and ſome Paſtors and Teachers: it was Chriſt gave them, and ſet them up in the Church. Hence ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Let a man ſo account of us as the Miniſters of Chriſt,</hi> we are ſet up and ſent by him, who is the Head of the Church, the Authour of all Offices, and Lord of all Offficers. Hence followes:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That thoſe Offices and Officers, are holy and warrantable, which depend upon the will and authority of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Jer. 1.5.</note> not thoſe are of the wils and authority of men, as all are in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue, and too many are amongſt us, Apoſtles, Prophets, Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, they were of Chriſt, but being extraordinary, are ceaſed; Paſtors, Teachers, Elders, Deacons, Chriſt hath given to be ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Officers in the Church, and their callings wee acknowledge holy and lawfull, but all others of humane inſtitution, and ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy and unwholeſome for the Church. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> deny the calling of Paſtors and Teachers in the reformed Churches to be lawfull, becauſe they are not ſent by the <hi>Pope,</hi> and ordained by his Biſhops, and ſo in ſucceſſion from Chriſt; but it's cleer, that
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:123227:129"/> Paſtors and Teachers were given of Chriſt, before ever <hi>Popes</hi> or <hi>Prelates</hi> were thought on, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11. And as for them, the <hi>Pope</hi> and his <hi>Clergie,</hi> wee may ſafely ſay, that neither himſelf, nor any of his <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> ever had any lawfull calling, becauſe none of them are ſent of Chriſt, hee will never own it, that he ſent any of them, neither were they ordained according to the will of Chriſt and his Apoſtles.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That men unable and unhoneſt in the Office of the Church, ſet up by him, were never ſent by him; hee gives gifts and graces to men, and then ſends them; the <hi>Spirit</hi> entred into <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and then, <hi>I ſend thee.</hi> He hath the power of ſending, it depends on his will, and that is ſacred, hee would not put in an inſufficient or corrupt man upon any terms, and therefore he hath ſet rules and lawes to ſhew what men hee would have in thoſe holy Functions, he hath given precedents of his own chooſing: <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.5. <hi>By whom wee received Grace and Apoſtleſhip,</hi> firſt Grace, and then Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtleſhip, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Who hath made us able Miniſters of the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> The Lord Chriſts Miniſters are able, not only in parts, but chiefly in the Spirit, that is light and life in them, ſuch hee ſends, ſuch hee approves; and as for ignorant and evill ones, ſee what the Lord ſaith, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Becauſe thou haſt rejected knowledge, I will alſo reject thee, that thou ſhalt be no Prieſt to mee;</hi> Chriſt would not have a prophane ignorant man to be in that Calling.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That thoſe are ſent of Chriſt may not delegate their power, and execute the office by others, but muſt do it themſelves; the Prophet might not appoint another, being ſent of Chriſt to the children of <hi>Iſrael; I ſend thee,</hi> and thou ſhalt ſay unto them, thus ſaith the Lord; Ambaſſadours are themſelves to deliver their meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, and not others for them, or in their ſtead; Miniſters are Ambaſſadors, and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. for Chriſt, and do preach and pray in Chriſts ſtead, who is their Head and Lord, whereupon, ſaith <hi>Paul, Wo unto mee, if I preach not the Goſpel,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.16. And what's the ground of it? Verſ. 17. <hi>The diſpenſation of the Goſpel is committed unto me;</hi> I am commanded to do it, I may not, I dare not commit or delegate this truſt, this power to others. Delegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is <hi>actus imperii,</hi> an act of power, and all the Officers of the Church muſt be obſequious, not imperious, therefore Hierarchiſts and thoſe that ſubſtitute others to preach in their ſtead, uſurpe
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:123227:130"/> the power of Chriſt, to whom it belongs to delegate men to preach in his ſtead, and over thouſands of Churches, if he pleaſe.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That thoſe Chriſt ſends and ſets over people, are by divine inſtitution, <hi>I ſend thee to the children of Iſrael,</hi> he was not a Prophet to others, but unto them, and that by divine authority, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. <hi>Take heed unto all the flock, over which the Holy Ghoſt hath made you over-ſeers;</hi> this was the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and the Elders of it were ſet there by no leſſe authority then that of the Holy Ghoſt, the Office, Power, Juriſdiction over ſuch a people is not humane, arbitrary, <hi>ad placitum,</hi> but of divine inſtitution.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That many are call'd, and ſeem to be <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> which in truth are not: the <hi>Jewes</hi> were call'd the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> here, and were ſo, according to the fleſh, but they were not ſo in the Spirit; they had not the principles of <hi>Jacob</hi> in them; they walked not in his ſteps; they had his name, but not his faith, they were call'd <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> but were not true <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> Rom. 9.6. <hi>they are not all Iſrael that are of Iſrael,</hi> in the true ſenſe of the Scripture, <hi>they are not all Iſrael;</hi> that is ſpirituall, ſuch as <hi>Jacob</hi> was, men of Prayer, wreſtling with God, prevailing like Princes, but they are of <hi>Iſrael</hi> according to the fleſh; and fleſhly <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> to whom the promiſes pertained not: in <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.12. they are called <hi>children of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> but yet ſuch as ſhould be caſt out into <hi>utter darkneſſe;</hi> they thought themſelves ſafe in being called ſo, and conceiting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſuch, but they were deluded: and ſo now many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands think themſelves <hi>Chriſtians, Saints,</hi> when in truth they are nothing leſſe, the very contrary, enemies to true <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and <hi>Saints.</hi> The <hi>Papiſts</hi> boaſt that they are <hi>Catholiques, Chriſtians,</hi> the Church of God; but it's in no better ſenſe then theſe rebellious <hi>Jewes</hi> are termed <hi>the children of Iſrael.</hi> What are titles, when truth is wanting? no other then a kind of blaſpheming, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.9. <hi>I know the blaſphemy of them, that ſay they are Jewes and are not;</hi> they were <hi>Jews</hi> by name, and did reproach the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and the Lord Chriſt, but were not <hi>Jewes</hi> in truth; <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.28, 29. <hi>Hee is not a Jew which is one outwardly in circumciſion of the fleſh; but hee is a Jew which is one inwardly, whoſe heart is circumciſed, and is one in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> Now theſe men ſaying they are <hi>Jewes,</hi> and were not, did blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme, much prejudice and wound the honourable name of being a <hi>Jew,</hi> and what were they? a Synogogue of Satan; and now

                  <p>Firſt, negatively, in the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, <hi>Be not afraid of them;</hi> I have made thee a Prophet, and it's not for a Prophet to feare the face of man.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, poſitively, in the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, where hee informs him, whoſe words he muſt ſpeak unto them; <hi>Thou ſhalt ſpeak my words unto them;</hi> it's not for a Prophet to ſpeak his own words, but the words of him that ſends him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, both negatively and poſitively in the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe; <hi>Be not thou rebellious, like the rebellious houſe;</hi> they will not heare me, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to my Lawes, walk in my wayes, they go after their own counſels, wils, luſts, but be not thou like them; and then poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, open thy mouth and eat that I give thee.</p>
                  <p>In the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe you have:

                  <p>The ſecond cauſe is their words: they will reproach thee, and ſeek by evill ſpeeches to diſcourage thee, but, <hi>Be not thou afraid of their words.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third is their looks; they will look ſtrangely, frown bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly,

                  </p>
                  <p>The fourth is their diſpoſition:

                     <p>Theſe words are four times mention'd in the verſe, to ſhew our aptneſſe unto fear, and to ſhew the forwardneſſe of the Lord Chriſt to cure our fear. The word <hi>diſmaid</hi> (there is no difficulty in the other) it comes from a word that ſignifies to bruiſe or beat in pieces; be not thou ſo affected with feare, as to have thy ſpirit faint, broken, ſink, and diſcouraged within thee; <hi>be not diſmaid,</hi> let not thy ſpirit yeeld at all, ſtand it out; ſhew thy ſelf a man of courage, a man of God, carrying thy ſelf in thy place, befitting the Son of God that put thee in that place.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, <hi>In their looks;</hi> that's in the Text alſo, there is much in the faces of men to daunt and trouble, mens ſpirits are much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd by their faces: <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.5. <hi>I ſee your fathers countenance is not towards me as before,</hi> by his face I find a difference in his ſpirit, ſaith <hi>Jacob</hi> to his wives, he found no favour in it; the face is the ſeat of favour or frowns, there is ſome Majeſty in the face and looks of man; and when he is angry, frowns, there is majeſticall terror in it: <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.23. there is mention of an angry countenance, and it's likened to a North-wind, which is cold and ſcattering; it drives away the clouds that have the rain in them: and oft times wicked men have ſuch Northern countenances, that they diſcourage, if not drive away, the Prophets, who come with the dewes of heaven. When men frown, knit their brows, look angerly, they have put on vizards, and they be ſcaring things: <hi>Job.</hi> 24.15. <hi>He diſguiſeth his face,</hi> hee is like a man that hath on ſome terrible vizard, which affrights thoſe behold it. One of the <hi>Nevils,</hi> Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> had ſo terrible a look when mov'd a little, that it was ſaid of him, every wrinkle in his forehead was a Sepulchre to bury a Prince in: he was of kin to that nation, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.50. that had fierce countenances; and <hi>Antiochus</hi> a wicked King, is deſcribed in <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.23. to be of <hi>a fierce countenance,</hi> his very aſpect was terrible; and ſome have been blaſted by the frowns of mortals. When ſome men frown, look ſowre, and ſparkle with their eyes, they prove Baſilisks, and kill thoſe they look upon.</p>
                     <pb n="257" facs="tcp:123227:143"/>
                     <p>Thirdly, Like <hi>thorns</hi> in their catching nature; they catch hold of a man when he thinks he is rid of them, and intangle him more: ſo wicked men, when you think you have ſatisfied them, and done with them, they catch hold again, they ſeek new advantages, <hi>Jer.</hi> 20.10. <hi>All my familiars watched for my halting, ſaying, Peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hee will be inticed, and wee ſhall prevail againſt him, and we ſhall take our revenge on him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The words, <hi>all my familiars,</hi> in the Hebrew are, <hi>every man of my peace,</hi> I thought I had ſatisfied all their cavils, ſlanders, objections, and that they had aimed at my peace and good, but they watched for my halting, they ſought to intice mee, and get advantage; this is the nature of wicked men. Chriſt, when he had to do with any ſort of them, he convinced them, ſtopt their mouths, they went their way and left him, and yet they were not ſatisfied, but ſent, and ſet men to catch him in his words, <hi>Mar.</hi> 12.13. When the godly fall into the Courts and Priſons where wicked men have ſome power, what advantages do they ſeek againſt them? and when nothing can be proved, no reaſon but they ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed, fees are multiplied, oaths and proteſtations tendered, and unleſſe theſe thorns may ſcratch them and draw blood from their purſes and conſciences, they will hold them faſt, and liberty muſt not be had.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, A <hi>Thorn</hi> will never alter its nature; ſet it in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den or Orchard, water it with milk or wine, do what you will to the thorn, when you have done all, a thorn is a thorn: ſo is the nature of wicked and ungodly men, tranſplant them whither you will, bring them from the countrey to the city, from the city to the court, put them in high or low places, bring them to the waters ſide, to the rivers of God, plant them in the Orchards of God, in Paradiſe it ſelf, under the means of grace; let them have the deaw of heaven, the ſhine of the Sun; a wicked man, he abides wicked ſtill, hee will not alter his nature, hee will be no more changeling, he is a <hi>Blackmore,</hi> and he will be a <hi>Blackmore,</hi> hee will live and die in his way, though he periſh in that way.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>Thorns</hi> are for the fire; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58.9. <hi>Before your pots can feel the thorns;</hi> the heat of the fire made with thorns, they are for burning, and that's the end of wicked ones. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10.17. <hi>The light of Iſrael ſhall be for a fire, and it ſhall burn and devoure his thorns,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:123227:144"/> and his briers in one day.</hi> In fire is light and heat, God would be light to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> comfort and joy, but heat and burning to the <hi>Aſsy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian;</hi> he ſent down fire to burn the ſacrifice, and hee would ſend a fire to burn the <hi>Aſsyrians</hi> which were briers and thorns to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and that in one day; and when was this? when hee ſent an Angel, and ſlew 185000. here was fire from heaven, a Seraphim, a coal of Juniper, that burnt up ſuch a thicket of briers and thorns, and after this fire they fell into a worſe, even the fire of hell, which is the place prepared for all the wicked; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.17. <hi>The wicked ſhall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God,</hi> there's their end, and hell is large enough to hold all, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.33. <hi>It's deep and large, the pile thereof is fire and much wood;</hi> it is <hi>ſilva execrabilis,</hi> ſuch wood the earth brought forth upon the curſe, briers and thorns, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.18. and the wicked are the fruit of the curſe. This phraſe <hi>much wood,</hi> ſome Expoſiters think hath reference to the fact of the <hi>Jewes,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Muſc.</note> when the 185000. <hi>Aſsyrians</hi> were ſlain in the valley of <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi> they made great piles of wood, and burnt thoſe bodies. So God hath piles of wood, thauſands and millions of wicked ones, briers and brambles heaped together, and his breath like a ſtream of brimſtone kindles thoſe heaps.</p>
                     <p>In what hath been ſaid you ſee wherein wicked men are thorns and briers; now I muſt preſent to you wherein they are <hi>Scorpions.</hi> You may by briers and thorns, underſtand wicked men of a lower condition; and by <hi>Scorpions</hi> thoſe of a higher, that have more power, means and opportunity to do miſchief: and the Analogie between the <hi>Scorpion</hi> and them, lies in theſe particulars.</p>

                     <p>The Obſervations that do ariſe from the Text are:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That he is the fitteſt man for publique imployment, is ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of his own naturalneſſe, weakneſſe and inſufficiencie for place or ſervice: <hi>Son of man, be not afraid;</hi> I ſee <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> that thou art ſenſible of thy own naturalneſſe, earthlineſſe and inſufficiencie, <hi>be not thou afraid,</hi> thou art the fitter man for my ſervice: <hi>Moſes</hi> pretended that hee was a man ſlow of ſpeech, and unfit for the great work of delivering Gods people, and leading them out of <hi>Egypt</hi> into <hi>Canaan,</hi> but hee was the fitter man for God: So thoſe Miniſters or Magiſtrates that are ſenſible of their own weakneſſes, they are fitteſt for Chriſt and Church ſervice, and the Lord Chriſt will ſhew his power moſt in their weakneſſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Thoſe that are in Gods work, and do intend heaven, they muſt look for afflictions, they muſt look for trouble: <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, I'll put thee into my ſervice, but know, thou muſt not go
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:123227:146"/> a ſmooth way, thou muſt meet with thorns and briers, thou ſhalt meet with Scorpions and Serpents; there is a Scorpion in heaven, and Scorpions on earth too; let a man be in a heavenly calling, a Prophet; let a man be in a worldly calling, a Magiſtrate; hee ſhall meet with Scorpions and Serpents, through many afflictions wee muſt enter into heaven, and it is well wee enter through ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny afflictions.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The way and method of the Lord Chriſt is to propound unto us the hardeſt things at firſt; he deals ſo with <hi>Ezekiel</hi> here, he heares of <hi>Thorns, Scorpions, a rebellious Houſe,</hi> and heares of that which might have diſcouraged him; but Chriſts way is to let you know what you muſt look for, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. <hi>You ſhall be hated of all men for my names ſake;</hi> you ſhall be carryed to the Court, you ſhall be ſcourged and whipped like rogues; you ſhall be brought before Governours; you ſhall be put to death; hee tells them all of theſe things:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, becauſe it was the way to arm them againſt thoſe evills: we ſay, <hi>praemoniti, praemuniti,</hi> men forewarn'd are forearm'd.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that they may have no cauſe to complain they met with worſe matters then ever they heard of.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, to ſtrengthen their faith when they ſhould ſee ſuch things fall out, they might ſay, theſe be the things which were foretold, and are tokens that we are in Chriſts way. God began the world with this method; <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. <hi>The evening and the morning was the firſt day,</hi> it is not the morning and the evening, but you muſt have night before day, a winter before a Spring, and thunder and lightning before a calm; and this is Chriſts way, therefore, if you intend heaven, think not to meet only with eaſe.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things are all generall; we come now to more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Obſervations.</p>

                  <p>But before we come to this roul, and the particulars of it, wee muſt ſpeak of Chriſts inſtructions to the Prophet.</p>
                  <p>In the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Verſe, where wee have,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, an exhortation, <hi>Son of man, heare what I ſay unto thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondy, a prohibition, <hi>be not thou rebellious, like that rebellious houſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, a command, <hi>open thy mouth, and eat that I give thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſumme of the Verſe is this; <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, ſee thou hearken unto my voyce, whatſoever I ſay to thee, let that be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable; regard not what men, what thine heart and carnall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſay to thee; but remember I am God and King, I ſit upon the Throne, my counſels and words muſt ſtand, be not thou rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as the <hi>Jewes</hi> are, let not their example, power, relation to thee, make thee refuſe to heare what I ſay, or to eat this viſible and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall ſign which I give thee.</p>
                  <p>There is nothing difficult in the Verſe to cleare up unto you, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe words, <hi>Open thy mouth,</hi> you may think ſuperfluous, and that the word <hi>Eat</hi> had been enough; but there is nothing idle in the Scripture, all is of weight, and ſuch weight, that heaven and earth ſhall paſſe away before one <hi>iota</hi> of Gods Word: it's a rule among the learned, <hi>Vox qua videtur otioſa plurimum facit ad effectum,</hi> it notes the ardent deſire of Chriſt, that the Prophet ſhould have the benefit of this ſacramentall ſign, and that hee ſhould be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and ready unto it, do any thing conduced that way.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſer.</hi> 1. That thoſe are to teach others, muſt firſt heare and be taught themſelves, they muſt heare Chriſt, and learne of him; <hi>Ezekiel</hi> muſt heare what Chriſt ſaith unto him, and then he would be fit to ſpeak unto others: when the Lord Chriſt ſent out his Diſciples he inſtructed them firſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. So the Apoſtles were in doctrinated forty dayes together in the things pertaining to the Kingdome of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.3. The inſtitution of Churches, the Lawes, Government, Ordinances, Offices and Officers of them, they were inſtructed in; and <hi>John</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 3.
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:123227:154"/> ſaith, <hi>That which wee have ſeen and heard declare wee unto you;</hi> and ſo it was of the Prophets, what they heard, that they ſpake, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1. <hi>God ſpake unto the fathers by the Prophets,</hi> he firſt ſpake to the Prophets, and in them to the Fathers; the Miniſters and Meſſengers of God muſt heare Chriſt firſt, and then declare his minde; be obedient unto his commands, and then mention and publiſh his Will.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God looks for more from them he calls to any ſervice then from others; and <hi>thou Son of man, be not thou rebellious,</hi> I expect other things at thy hand, I look thou ſhouldeſt be as tractable as they have been untractable, as dutifull as they have bin rebellious, you ſee who have been moſt active among them againſt me, I look thou ſhouldeſt be as active in thy place for mee; thoſe God doth put honour upon, and ſet in publike places, it's equall hee ſhould have much from, yea, more then from others: ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> The Lord Chriſt inabled me, counted me faithfull, put me into the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. and 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 15.10. <hi>His grace which was beſtowed upon me was not in vain, but I laboured more abundantly then they all.</hi> God had done much for him, expected it as his hands; and hee deceived not expectation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. See here, what God accounts rebellion, wee think it muſt be ſome great notorious thing that makes a Rebell or rebellious; but there is great difference between the judgement of men, and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God. If <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſhould be difficult and backward to his work hee call'd him unto, he would count it rebellion, if he would not heare and do what God bid him, hee ſhould be numbred among the rebellious; if hee did not heare every thing that Chriſt ſpake, <hi>quecun<expan>

                  <p n="4">4. That we muſt nor follow the examples and wayes of ſinfull men, <hi>be not thou rebellious like that rebellious houſe;</hi> they have ſet an ill example before thee, do not thou imitate them, they have writ
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:123227:155"/> a foul copy, write not after them, they have walked in wrong paths, do not trace their ſteps; ſuch men uſually are, as thoſe they live with; it's eaſie to grow naught, if wee live among thoſe are naught: <hi>Joſeph</hi> learn'd to ſweare in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Court, and <hi>Peter</hi> to Judaiſe among the <hi>Jewes;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Praecepta du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunt, exempla trahunt.</note> Conſent and example of others, is like a mighty torrent that carries down all before it; Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample is a potent thing: <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Why compelleſt thou the Gentiles to Judaize?

But thou wilt object and ſay, They are my friends that perſwade mee, my kindred, mine own fleſh and blood that counſell mee, they are great ones, yea, all, Prince and People, that go that way, they are my parents that command me to do ſo, and I may ſin in refuſing to hearken unto them, the Lord Chriſt takes off all theſe and other objections, <hi>be not rebellious</hi> as they have been, and are, but conſider; are they friends, kindred, great, Parents? and have they and theirs long been in that way? know, that I that ſpeak to thee, am thy friend, and beſt friend thou haſt; I am thy kinſman, I am here in the form of the Son of man, and to ſuffer in thy nature hereafter, that thou mayeſt be the Son of God, I am thy brother, who hath redeemed thee from ſin, death and hell; if others be great, I am greater then they, and my Throne is above all thrones; if they be thy parents, I am thy everlaſting Father, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6. and as I have had everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing care of thee, ſo do give thee everlaſting Lawes and Rules of worſhip and godlineſſe, in compariſon of whoſe light and wiſdome all men are darkneſſe and folly; and what? will you prefer friends, kindred, great ones, parents, any before me? <hi>be not rebellious</hi> like them, but hearken unto mee, and let them go, make no league with them, that are wicked and rebellious, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.12. do not imitate their worſhip, match not into their families, feaſt not at their tables; chooſe none of their wayes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.31. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Be not conformed to this world, but be yee transformed by the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your minde;</hi> that is, do not make the manners of the world,

                  <p n="5">5. That it's the Lords prerogative to appoint ſignificant typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and ſacramentall ſignes: <hi>Eat what I give thee,</hi> that was the roul which was ſacramentall, and ſignified the gift of prophecy; No man may lift up a creature to a higher ſpirituall excellency, then what God has ſet it in by nature; what mortall had power to have put upon the brazen Serpent a typicalneſſe to repreſent Chriſt? who had power to make the Rain-bow a ſign of the Covenant between God and man? who could make the Temple a type of Chriſt, but hee that fill'd the Temple with glory? and who can inſtitute Sacraments, ordinary or extraordinary, but God and Chriſt? in them alwayes is a Command and a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of grace, which falls not within the compaſſe of mans power.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That the Lord Chriſt provides meat for his ſervants: <hi>Eat what I give thee;</hi> Chriſt had propheticall meat for him, <hi>a roul</hi> to give him.

                  <p>HEre wee have the efficient inſtrumentall and materiall cauſe to treat of: <hi>A hand was ſent unto mee;</hi> ſent from Chriſt; there could not be a hand without ſome Author, hee that ſate upon the Throne, and made all, he made, he ſent this hand; no mention is made of any arm or body; a hand might write it, and reach it forth; <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.5. there was in <hi>Belſhazzars</hi> ſad viſion; the fingers of a hand came forth, and wrote upon the plaiſter of the wall, nothing but a hand appeared; had there been no hand, the Prophet might have doubted whence it came, taken it for ſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall thing; but being reached out by a hand, it was evident to him, it came from heaven, even him that he ſaw ſo glorious, fell down before, and was comforted by.</p>
                  <p>The materiall cauſe is, <hi>A roul of a book, Megillath Sepher:</hi> the Ancients at firſt writ in barks of trees, afterwards in skins of beaſts, which they call <hi>Pergamena,</hi> vellum, or parchment, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them to be invented at <hi>Pergamus,</hi> by King <hi>Attalus,</hi> where was a famous Library of parchments and manuſcripts, but rouls of vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume or parchment were before that time. <hi>Ezekiels</hi> viſion was long before the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchie; <hi>Attalus</hi> lived when that flouriſhed, and having no iſſue, made the <hi>Roman</hi> State heir to his crown; but <hi>rouls</hi> were in <hi>Iſaiah's</hi> dayes, <hi>Chapt.</hi> 8.1. <hi>Take thee a great roul;</hi> yea, in <hi>Davids</hi> dayes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.8. <hi>In the volume of thy book, Bimgillath Sepher, in the roul of thy book.</hi> They are very ancient, and call'd <hi>rouls</hi> from the rouling them up about Cedar, or ſome precious wood, that they might be the better preſerved. The Law and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were written in ſuch rouls, and when they unrouled them, the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors uſed to expound them,<note place="margin">Nihil eſt vetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum in princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pum Archivis quod non ſit ſcriptum in voluminibus, <hi>Calv.</hi>
                     </note> as is gathered from that place, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.17.

<pb n="283" facs="tcp:123227:156"/> of Monuments, but is written in rouls or volumes.</p>
                  <p>For the ſignification of this <hi>Roul,</hi> ſome make it to ſignifie the ſecret counſells of God; it's true, they were written in it, but not ſignified by it. The <hi>Roul</hi> here, is <hi>ſymbolum Prophetiae,</hi> a typicall ſign of the gift of prophecie to be given to the Prophet, and in that ſenſe wee are to take it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 1. That the Lord Chriſt doth at his pleaſure put forth creative and infinite vertue to effect what hee ſpeaks: <hi>Eat what I give thee,</hi> and preſently <hi>a Hand</hi> is created, <hi>a Roul</hi> is preſented un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Prophet, which none could have done, being deſtitute of divine power. Chriſt hath <hi>a Hand</hi> in readineſſe alwayes to do what he will have done; he hath ſometimes a viſible hand to do it, as here; ſometime an inviſible, when hee call'd <hi>Lazarus</hi> forth of the grave, he had an hand inviſible to effect it, when he bid the dead to heare, the dumb to ſpeak, the lame to walk, Devils to depart their habitation, hee had an inviſible hand that effected thoſe things; ſo in <hi>Acts</hi> 11.20, 21. when ſome of the Brethren had preached the Lord Chriſt, and faith in him, it's ſaid preſently <hi>the hand of the Lord was with him, and a great number believed;</hi> there was a ſecret hand of divine power effecting that in their hearts, which the Diſciples preached in their ears: And <hi>Acts</hi> 4.30. Chriſt hath a hand to ſtretch forth, and to heal, to heal ſoul diſeaſes, and bodily too, to heal State and Church diſeaſes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.2, 3. The Leper ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>Lord, if thou wilt, thou canſt make me clean, and Jeſus put forth his hand, and touched him, ſaying: I will, be thou clean;</hi> and immediatly his Leproſie was cleanſed; if wee would look to Chriſt as this Leper did, wee might find and feel the hand of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the Lord doth often times extraordinary things for the incouragement and confirmation of his ſervants in their Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Here is a <hi>Hand</hi> and a <hi>Roul</hi> reached out to <hi>Ezekiel. Jeremiah</hi> is fearefull and backward to the work of God, and God to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage and eſtabliſh him, puts forth his hand,<note place="margin">Exod. 4.</note> and toucheth his mouth, <hi>Jer.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Moſes</hi> hee is doubting, and pleading with God to diſmiſſe him, but by the miracles of the ſerpentined and unſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentined rod, of the leprozed and unleprozed hand, he confirms in his call to that great and hard ſervice; <hi>Iſaiahs</hi> lips are touched with a coal from the Altar in the hand of a Seraphim, his iniquity is
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:123227:157"/> purged, and ſo hee is heartened to his work, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. Chriſt breathed upon his Apoſtles, and ſaid <hi>Receive the Holy Ghoſt, Joh.</hi> 20.22. By theſe extraordinary things they were conſecrated to, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in their offices.</p>
                  <p n="3">3.

                        <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 1. That divine myſteries are unknown to men, though very eaſie and familiar, till they be unfolded; this <hi>Roul</hi> could the Prophet never have comprehended the meaning of, if Chriſt had not opened it; take all the types and ceremonies of the Law, there were myſteries wrapped up in them, which neither <hi>Aaron</hi> nor <hi>Moſes</hi> had known, if they had been left to their own abilities; thoſe elements uſed in Baptiſme and the Supper of the Lord, we ſhould never have known the myſteries of them, if heaven had not helped us: would we think the Rain-bow an Embleme of mercy, if Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had not held it out to us? <hi>Indians, Heathens,</hi> do not, cannot ſo apprehend it; take any divine myſteries, they are too tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent for our capacities; there be depths in them that wee cannot fathome, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. the naturall man cannot know the things of God, they are ſpiritually diſcerned, there muſt be a great myſterie wrought in him before he can diſcern myſteries.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It's the Lord Chriſt that opens and interprets myſticall things, efficaciouſly unto the faithfull, hee ſpread the <hi>Roul</hi> before <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and made him to underſtand the myſteries of it; what is the Scriptures but a roul folded up? a book ſealed till Chriſt open it; we may all ſay as the Eunuch, being demanded if he underſtood what he read; ſaid, <hi>How can I, except ſome man guide mee?</hi> Act. 8.30, 31. ſo unleſſe Chriſt guide us, and lead us into the myſteries of the Word, wee cannot underſtand, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.5. When none could open the booke ſealed up, <hi>the Lion of the tribe of Judah</hi> could do it. He hath ſtrength to untie all knots, and a ſpirit to ſearch all deeps; Chriſt himſelf is the greateſt myſterie, and he is the great opener of myſteries, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.27. <hi>All things are delivered to mee and my Father, and no man knowes the Father, ſave the Son, and hee to whom the Son will reveal him;</hi> if ever God be made known ſavingly to the ſoul, it muſt be by the Lord Chriſt; and hee doth not reveal unto all, but to whomſoever hee will, to his Elect ones, from others hee conceals him, they have the Letter, the Roul, but not
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:123227:158"/> the myſterie thereof, their light is darkneſſe. But there be ſome in the world, that Chriſt doth interpret the riddles and dark things of the Scripture unto; ſee that place in <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.15. Hence, firſt ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I call yee not ſervants, for the ſervant knoweth not what his Lord doth, but I have call'd you friends, for all things that I have heard of my father, I make known unto you;</hi> theſe were Chriſts friends, Chriſt revealed all to them, but from other all was kept; it was Chriſt revealed unto the Prophets, what they had, and to the Apoſtles what they had; the Scripture may well be call'd <hi>the Revelation of Chriſt:</hi> you have one Book call'd ſo, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.1. <hi>The Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, which God gave unto him, to ſhew unto his ſervants,</hi> that is, his faithfull ones: if we would therefore underſtand the Roul of the Book, the myſteries in the Scripture, wee muſt look up to Chriſt, and intreat him to ſpread them before our eyes, and to interpret them to our hearts.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That the ſervants of God muſt not refuſe to receive and propound large and ſad meſſages to the people: Here is a <hi>Roul, writ within and without,</hi> and fill'd with <hi>lamentations, mourning and woe.</hi> Here was <hi>liber mortis,</hi> a book of death, and deadly things; this the Prophet muſt receive, and declare to the people, how ever they take it; people would gladly heare from the men of God good tidings, they would have a law of kindneſſe in our lips, our mouths to drop honey; they would have us ſons of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, but wee muſt ſpeak what our great Lord and Maſter puts into the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="4">4 That the Lord gives to his Prophets, truh's ſuitable to his Providence: Here's a <hi>Roul,</hi> full of <hi>lamentations, mournings and woes;</hi> ſad things, and ſuch things the Lord was bringing upon them; there is a ſweet Analogie between Gods Word and Works. His works are his Word fulfill'd, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148.8. <hi>Fire and hail, ſnow and vapour, ſtorm wind, fulfilling his Word,</hi> when there is thunder and lightning, ſnowes, rains and winds, theſe are fulfillings of Gods Word, no providences do croſſe his Word, but all perform it. Gods works are the beſt Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries upon his Word; and had we the wiſdome to bring his Word and Works together, we ſhould ſee a ſweet harmony be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them.

                  <p>In theſe Verſes is little that needs explaining; that hath moſt
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:123227:160"/> difficulty in it, is the <hi>eating of the roul;</hi> what eating is here meant? how could the Prophet eat a great roul (a thing not credible) without prejudice of his health, life, or both?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> He that commanded him to eat, could have prevented all danger and prejudice, if the eating had been corporall and literall; but it's conceived here, that the eating was not lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, but ſpirituall, <hi>per viſionem,</hi> ſaith one Expoſiter, <hi>non re ipſa, ſed ſpiritu,</hi> ſaith another; and that in the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Verſe of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter confirms us in it, where it's ſaid, <hi>All my words that I ſhall ſpeak unto thee, receive in thine heart, and heare with thine eares,</hi> this was the eating, to heare, meditate, and believe, his journey was ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, his work was ſpirituall; he was to go and propheſie, and ſuch was his meat, ſpirituall meat, and ſpiritually eaten.</p>
                  <p>But why is hee bid to eat the roul? had not ſeeing and reading been more ſuitable? look on it, read it; why is the mouth brought in rather then the eye or eare?</p>

Let not us be lift up, our Maſter Chriſt had in him all the treaſures of Wiſdome, the Spirit above meaſure; he was full of grace and truth, did more then all, his fame was great, and yet he was humble, and bade us learn of him; he did not ſleight or deſpiſe men of mean talents, and infinitly beneath himſelf, but acknowledged the leaſt good was in any, and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged it; his ſteps ſhould wee follow, and not ſwell with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of worth, nor with reality of parts and excellencies; it's the practice of too many to ſleight others, and build up themſelves by their ruines, but this is a worldly and wicked practice, never taught by Chriſt, his Doctrine is, Let each eſteem others better then themſelves, <hi>Look not every man on his own things, but on the things of others,</hi> Phil. 2.3, 4. it's injury and indignity to Chriſt, not to reverence and eſteem his graces and gifts in others. <hi>Bernard</hi> tells of one, who beweiling his own condition, ſaid, he ſaw thirty vertues in another, whereof he had not one in himſelf, and perhaps, ſaith <hi>Bernard,</hi> of all his thirty, he had not one like this mans hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:123227:166"/> this grace is the glory of a Chriſtian, and eſpecially of a Miniſter; pride is for Prelates, and humility for Prophets; God brooks not pride in any, leaſt of all in his Meſſengers: Chriſts Diſciples had a tincture of it, their thoughts were aſpiring, who ſhould be greateſt, but he ſets a child before them, and tells them, who is greateſt, not he that hath the ſtrongeſt head, the beſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, doth the moſt ſervice, but he is the moſt humble, he is the moſt high; humility is ſo valued of God, that he likes it in <hi>male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factis,</hi> rather then pride in <hi>recte factis;</hi> a man that is innocent and proud, is leſſe in Gods eye, then he that is guilty and humble: let us rather minde the good in others, to honour them, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain love, then that is in our ſelves to lift us up, and make us ſleight others.</p>

                     <head>The Spirit took me up.</head>
                     <p>By <hi>Spirit</hi> here we underſtand, not the wind, as if ſome great wind ſhould take up the Prophet, nor an Angel, as if hee had been lift up by Angelicall vertue, nor his own ſpirit, as <hi>Jerome</hi> would have it, but that <hi>Spirit</hi> which was in <hi>the living creatures and wheels,</hi> Chap. 1.12, 20. <hi>and led them;</hi> that Spirit entred into <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and ſet him upon his feet, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.2. That <hi>Spirit</hi> which led Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Wilderneſſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.1. even the eternall <hi>Spirit</hi> of God.</p>
                     <p>This taking up of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God was:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. To perfect and ratifie his Call to the Propheticall Office; the Lord Chriſt had ſpoken much unto him about it, and now the
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:123227:168"/> 
                        <hi>Spirit</hi> lifts him up, and ſeals the ſame unto his ſoul, ſtrengthening him in the full aſſurance thereof; when hee had heard Chriſts voyce, and found his Spirit working ſo extraordinarily, as to lift him up; this could not but mightily prevail with, and ſatisfie the ſoule of the Prophet.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That hee might have a more cleer and full view of the glory of him that ſate upon the Throne: when wee would have one ſee things diſtinctly and fully, wee ſet or lift him up on high. The Devill carryed Chriſt unto an exceeding high mountain, and ſhewed him the glory of the kingdomes of the world, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.8.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. To put honour upon him, in letting him ſee, that he was to be an organ of the Spirit for the future, he was to be imploy'd in great ſervice by the Spirit, and that was a great honour. Hee was to be the mouth of the Spirit unto that people; to be wholly at the diſpoſe of the Spirit.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. To avocate his thoughts from things below, and to ſettle them upon contemplation of things divine; a Prophet is not to look downward, his heart ſhould be lifted up to heaven, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things.</p>

                     <p>It was not the voyce of thunder, or of an earth-quake, but of <hi>the living creatures;</hi> and the voyce ſome make to be the words: <hi>Bleſſed is the glory of the Lord from his place;</hi> which words are in the originall, <hi>the bleſſed glory of the Lord from his place;</hi> that is, the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God is now going out of his place, and it troubles the Angels, that they lament, and make a great noyſe, to behold ſo dreadfull a judgement to befall <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the <hi>Jewes;</hi> and ſo the voyce to be differing from theſe words. If it be granted, that theſe words were the voyce uttered, yet may they be taken in that ſenſe, as is expreſſed, to ſhew their ſorrow for the ruine of the Church, The bleſſed glory of the Lord is departing from its place, God is leaving his habitation and people, and all is haſtening to ſpoyl and deſolation, this affected the very Angels: when ſome great man, that hath been a great Patron and friend to a place, is going away; what lamentation is made? what a noyſe and ſtir is there at it? as in theſe dayes, when ſome Miniſters, Magiſtrates, and other eminent Chriſtians, are forced from their place by the
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:123227:169"/> enemies, what complaint doth it cauſe? what a noyſe doth it make? and ſo when God leaves a people, that were beloved and deare unto him, it fetches ſighs and complaints, not only from men, but even from angels alſo; the ſoul finds it a ſad thing when God departs from it, and oft mourns bitterly. Some take the words for a <hi>Doxologie,</hi> and make the ſenſe this; <hi>Bleſſed be the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, which is ſeen in puniſhing the wicked, and delivering the Church.</hi> God ſhewes himſelf juſt and righteous, that he will no longer ſtay among a ſinful people, but be gone from them, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to them according to their wayes. The Quere will be, in what ſenſe we may take the words? both ſenſes may without prejudice be admitted, while the Angels looked upon the great loſſe the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould have by Gods departure, the great evils would follow ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon; they ſympathized, and were ſo affected with it, that they brake out into theſe expreſſions, <hi>The bleſſed glory of God is going out of its place,</hi> and ſo it was <hi>vox lamentationis;</hi> but when they look'd at Gods Juſtice and holineſſe, they ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed is,</hi> or, <hi>be the glory of the Lord.</hi> Though men be ruin'd, Cities and Nations de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and God driven from his habitation, yet let his Name be glorious, and ſo it's <hi>vox laudis,</hi> and brought in to anſwer the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections and Cavils the people might make; they might ſay: What? will God leave us? expoſe us to the people of forain enemies? ſhall we and ours be cut off? will he thus deal with his people? is it come to this? What equity is in it? The Angels, to prevent ſuch murmurings, and vile ſpeech, ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed, &amp;c.</hi> even when hee is in a way of judgement, hee is to be honoured and made glorious.</p>

                     <p>Wee muſt make ſome ſearch into theſe words, and inquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the perſon, the place and the glory.

<pb n="309" facs="tcp:123227:169"/> would be gone, and take away that which was the chief glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of it.</p>

                     <head>From his place.</head>
                     <p>God is illocall, and the Rabbins uſe that word, to ſignifie Gods illocality; which notes place; <hi>Makom</hi> is a ſpace, or place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all things ſubſiſt in them; <hi>Hammakom, per Antiphrafin,</hi> is <hi>illocalis, infinitus,</hi> one that ſubſiſts, or is comprehended in no place, and ſo is an attribute of God. How then is God here ſaid to have place <hi>Nimekomo, From his place?</hi> God properly hath no place, it's <hi>ſenſu metaphorico,</hi> that place is given to him; where hee in any ſpeciall manner doth manifeſt his glory, power, grace and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that is ſaid to be his place.</p>
                     <p>And three places God is ſaid to have in the Scripture:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The heavens; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.1. <hi>Heaven is my throne,</hi> and 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.30. <hi>heare in heaven thy dwelling place.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. The <hi>humble heart, Iſa.</hi> 57.15. that is Gods dwelling place. And</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The <hi>Temple in Sion, Pſal.</hi> 132.13, 14. <hi>Sion</hi> was his habitation, there was his reſt and abode, that is, in the <hi>Temple,</hi> being in <hi>Sion, in the Temple and Sanctuary,</hi> were his voyce, his <hi>Way, Pſal.</hi> 18.6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.13. That was the place where his <hi>honour dwelt, Pſal.</hi> 26.8. <hi>The habitation of his glory.</hi> The words are in the originall, <hi>the place of the habitation</hi> or <hi>Tabernacle of his glory,</hi> alluding to that in <hi>Exod.</hi> 40.24, 25. where it's ſaid, The glory of the Lord filled the <hi>Tabernacle.</hi> So the glory of the Lord filled the <hi>Temple;</hi> there was the preſence of God; there was manifeſtations of his glory; there hee heard Prayers, and there he gave out many gracious anſwers; there he accepted of their ſacrifices, and communicated himſelf unto them; there was the Ark and ſign of Gods preſence, and the Cherubims, from between which God gave out the anſwers. In theſe things lay the glory of the <hi>Temple,</hi> but now God would be gone, and all the glory of the <hi>Temple</hi> ſhould depart; God moved not from place to place, being infinite, illocall, immovable; but he is ſaid to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, when he ceaſes to do as formerly hee did, in the ſoul, when you find not God acting and manifeſting himſelf, you ſay hee is gone. Here now God would anſwer them no more, not accept their ſacrifice, nor heare their prayers, &amp;c. hee would not do as formerly he had done; he would not protect them any longer,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:123227:170"/> but look upon them as being unworthy of his preſence, glory, protection and hope, and in his wrath leave them to ruine and ſpoyl of their adverſaries, and this was Gods departing according to that in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5.15. <hi>I will go and return to my place, till they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their offence.</hi> That phraſe, <hi>bleſſed glory of the Lord,</hi> you may for the better underſtanding, conceive thus; <hi>Bleſſed be the glorious Lord,</hi> or, <hi>the glory, the Lord;</hi> or, if you will take it as it's read, the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, that the glory of the Lord is to be celebrated.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 1. That thoſe that are call'd to imployment in the Church of Chriſt, have need not only of Chriſts word, but Chriſts Spirit alſo; Chriſt had ſpoken largely unto <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and here the Spirit lifts him up, and doth in eſpeciall manner animate and arm him to the work; when the Apoſtles had been long with Chriſt, heard his Sermons, ſeen his Miracles, life, joyned with him in prayer, all this would not do it, though Chriſt had forty dayes ſpoken to them in pa ticular of the things of the Kingdome, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.3. till they had the Spirit, and were fill'd with that; therefore Chriſt bid them wait for it, he knew they had need of it <hi>ver.</hi> 4. and that it would do more in them, then all he had ſaid unto them, the Spirit would be <hi>Doctor intus,</hi> and acquaint them with all truth. The Spirit would purge out their feares and diſtempers, it would warm, heat, ſeal, ratifie and make them reſolute in the work.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That the Angels do ſympathiſe with the Church and people of God in their miſeries. This voyce was, as I ſhewed in the opening, the voyce of the living creatures, and they made a noiſe, lamenting the ſtate of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> God being upon the leaving of it, and expoſing it to great miſery; Ah, ſaid they, the bleſſed and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Lord is going from his place, and all miſeries are now ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in upon his people, this affected them; wee know that the Angels reioyce at the converſion of ſinners, and by the Law of contraries we infer they are ſadded at the deſtruction of ſinners, of States and Churches; they have been imployed to comfort in trouble; and where there is no ſympathy, there is little ſolace. Do you not think, that the Angel ſeeing Chriſt his Lord and Maſter in his agony, that hee did ſympathiſe firſt with him, and then ſtrengthen him? Angels being without ſin, are as full of pity as the Devils are of cruelty: God, Chriſt and the Spirit, are full
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:123227:170"/> of pity, and it cannot be, that Angels which are ſo neer them, ſhould be voyd of it, no, they have a holy ſympathy with us; in Gods departure from a place is ſad newes, even to Angels.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The happineſſe of a people, is to have the Lord and his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry amongſt them, and their greateſt miſery is to have God depart from them; moſt think the happineſſe of a people to lie in liberty, honour, plenty of all things; <hi>David</hi> once ſubſcribed to it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144.15. <hi>Happy are the people are in ſuch a caſe,</hi> but he quickly croſſeth out that ſubſcription, and ſaid, <hi>yea, happy is that people whoſe God is their Lord;</hi> there's the happineſſe to have God amongſt them, hee is the glory of a people, <hi>Zach.</hi> 2.5. hee was the glory in the midſt of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> there God dwelt, as his worſhip, Laws, oracles, miracles, teſtified, and ſo hee made <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> glorious among all nations. Where true Religion is, pure Worſhip and Ordinances, and God working for the good of a people, defending them, that is the glory and excellency of a kingdome, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13.25. ſaith <hi>Abijah, God is with us for our Captain,</hi> this was more then all the ſtrength of <hi>Judah</hi> beſide, when <hi>Jeroboam</hi> came againſt him with 800000 choſen men, With you are the golden calves; <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. <hi>you have a great number,</hi> but God is not with you to be your glory and defence, you have the calves, which is your ſhame and nakedneſſe, but God is with us, who is our glory and defence. And when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> fell to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, God tels them, <hi>that they had changed their glory for that did not profit,</hi> Jer. 2.11. they had driven away their glory; and here was the beginning of their woe. That's the miſery of a kingdome, to have God depart from it, then publike enterpriſes proſper not, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22.24. then counſell failes, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.15. protection is gone, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.5. then peace, loving kindneſſe and mercies go, <hi>Jer.</hi> 16.5. This is as taking the Sun out of the firmament, the eyes out of the head, or ſoul out of the body; now a kingdome and people lie expoſed to all evils and miſchiefs, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 9.12. <hi>Wo to them when I depart from them,</hi> all miſchiefes preſently ſtep, croud in upon a people left of God; famine, wars, captivity, a perverſe ſpirit, and treacherouſneſſe one to another, came upon this people, when God left his place. And ſo after Chriſts dayes, when God left them, and that voyce was heard in the Temple, <hi>Migremus hinc,</hi>

Let Councels, Fathers, Churches, give their ſenſe of Scripture, it's private, if it be not the ſenſe and interpretation of the Spirit: Let a private man give the true ſenſe of the Scripture, it's not private, becauſe it's divine; the ſenſe of the Holy Ghoſt, and private in this place of <hi>Peter,</hi> is not oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to publique, but to divine; and the words are to be read, no Scripture is of a mans own interpretation; that is, private, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to divine.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Holy Ghoſt is God, and a perſon diſtinct from the Son; the Spirit was in the living creatures, in the wheeles, and in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> how could this be, if the Spirit were not God? none but God can be at the ſame time in many places; it's his peculiar prerogative and nature to be every where. The beams of the Sun are in ſeverall places, but not the eſſence or body of the Sun, that is in one place only, but the Holy Ghoſt was in its eſſence, in the Angels, in the wheels, in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> it was in <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> who lived then at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> it was in all the Saints there, in <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the reſt of the Saints in <hi>Babylon;</hi> ſo that the Spirit is co-eſſentiall with the Father and the Son, and it's a perſon; otherwiſe how could it have taken up the Prophet, and carried him? and it's diſtinct

Great Saints have great infirmities: <hi>Ezekiel</hi> goes in bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in the heat of his ſpirit, hee was in a froward humour, in a great diſtemper, the Vulgar hath it, <hi>in indignatione ſpiritus,</hi> there was indignation in his ſpirit to the worke; ſome have thought this affection of the Prophet, <hi>Non prorſus vitioſum,</hi> not altogether ſinfull, yet ſome ſinfulneſſe, and vitioſity to be in it, cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed: it's granted by <hi>Calvin,</hi> that it did <hi>diſtare a gratia ſpiritus,</hi> and for him after ſo cleer and ſtrong a Call, to refuſe, to be in a chafe, to withſtand, was <hi>affectus penitus vitioſus,</hi> if not <hi>vilis,</hi> he had rather have been out of ſervice then in it, lien hid among the people, then have been an Ambaſſadour of Chriſt unto them; he had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſhould have periſhed without Viſion, then that himſelf ſhould be a ſeer amongſt them; here was the weakneſſe of this good man. I could tell you of <hi>Abrahams; Jacobs, Moſes, Davids, Pauls,</hi> and <hi>Johns</hi> failings: there was never ſince ſin entred, any Saint, <hi>ſine omni macula,</hi> in many things we ſin all, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.2. And yet the Apoſtles were fill'd with the <hi>Spirit,</hi> there was a fulneſſe of grace in them, and in the Prophets, yet neither the one nor the other were <hi>omni prorſus exuti carne,</hi> notwithſtanding all their graces and excellencies, they did ſtill <hi>terreſtre aliquid ſpirare;</hi> and now where ever the Spirit comes, it neither extinguiſheth nature nor corruption wholly in this life; the beſt wine hath its dregs and its lees, and the beſt of Saints hath his ſpots and weakneſſes, there is no perfection in any.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Holy men, ſet down their own infirmities, which is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the truth of the Word and the divine nature of it, men that are meere men ſeek their own glory, and will not ſhame them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their Writings, but the Pen-men of Scripture having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived another Spirit, are content to ſhame themſelves, ſo God may have glory, his truth credit, his people caution and comfort, all theſe are in the ſetting down of their own ſins, when holy men confeſſe their weakneſſes, ſet them down, as <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 4. as <hi>David

God is glorified by their ſhame; it's evidenced what God did for, and by theſe men, notwithſtanding their ſins, men are perſwaded of the truth of the Word, ſeeing they ſpared not themſelves, and would not bury their own thoughts in ſilence; others that ſee the ſlips of ſuch men of God, are admoniſhed thereby to look to their ſtandings and to be watchfull, and theſe are beaten down with the ſenſe of their failings, ſee it's the common ſickneſſe of the Saints, and not their caſe alone, which is ſome eaſe unto them.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That ſome truths of God, ſweet in the reception, oft prove bitter in the operation: the roul that <hi>Ezekiel</hi> did eat, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. was ſweet as honey at firſt unto him; but now hee was to go and put it in practice, he found it bitter, and ſought to decline that ſervice, it was like pils ſugared over, ſweet in the mouth, but being diſſolved in his bowels, <hi>viſcera torquebat &amp; torminibus lacerabat praecordia.</hi> He was upon the wrack, and ſick of the buſineſſe, and perplexed that he had eaten ſuch a roul. The ſtony ground heard the Word with joy, it was ſweet to the taſte, but after it was bitter, when perſecution and temptation came; thoſe hearers were offended and fell away, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.20, 21. the word of joy proved a word of bitterneſſe unto them, and it's ſo to moſt men at one time or other, they find it a ſad and difficult thing to act thoſe truths are ſweet to the underſtanding, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.9, 10. <hi>John</hi> eat the little book, it was ſweet in his mouth, bitter in his belly; that is, in the operation of it; <hi>John</hi> ſaw that thoſe truths writ in it would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get hatreds, perſecutions, impriſonments, baniſhments, martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, &amp;c. When wee come to find the operations of truths, that they will coſt us deare, deare friends, deare liberties, deare luſts, deare lims, deare lives; we find a bitterneſſe in truths, though for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly they have been like <hi>Ezekiels</hi> roul, and <hi>Johns</hi> little book to our mouths.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Mans wiſdome and ſpirit is oppoſite to the wiſdome and Spirit of the Lord Chriſt. Chriſt calls, ſends <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in his infinit wiſdome, hee thinks it beſt for him to go to theſe captive <hi>Jewes;</hi> this rebellious houſe. The <hi>Spirit</hi> enters into <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> aſſures him of his Call, aſſumes him, aſſiſts him, and yet hee is averſe, in bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe, in the heat of his ſpirit; hee ſhewes the antipathy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his wiſdome and Chriſts, his ſpirit, and the Spirit of Chriſt
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:123227:174"/> they cloſed not. There are principles of oppoſition in godly men to the wayes of Chriſt and his Spirit; ſo far as they are unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, ſo far they are oppoſite, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. <hi>The carnall mind is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity againſt God;</hi> it's in the originall, <hi>the wiſdome of the fleſh is enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty againſt God,</hi> there is fleſh in the beſt men, that fleſh hath wiſdom, it hath a ſpirit, (the fleſh is the old man, a whole man, and muſt have a ſpirit in it to act it, ſuch a one as it is) and both the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and ſpirit of the fleſh are enmity to God, unſubject to his Law and Will; and enmity to man, they work death, and end in death; <hi>Jonas</hi> had ſuch wiſdome, and ſuch a ſpirit in him, when he ran from God; but it had coſt him his life, if God had not been more gracious then he dutifull: <hi>Paul</hi> complains, hee found a law in his members, warring againſt the law of his mind, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. <hi>The fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit;</hi> the work of the fleſh is luſting and warring againſt the ſpirit: it is with a godly man, as it was with <hi>Rebecca,</hi> ſhe had great ſtruglings in her womb, and what was the cauſe of it? there were two nations in her womb, one contrary to the other;<note place="margin">Gen. 25.22, 23.</note> and there is heaven and earth in a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mans heart, which are contrary, and make great ſtruglings: The ſame ſoul commands obedience, oppoſeth obedience; the ſame will that delights in the Law of God, hath a croſſe motion to the law of ſin; the heart that truſteth God, doubts of his favour; while we are believing, unbeliefe is oppoſing, <hi>Mark.</hi> 9.24. <hi>I believe, Lord help my unbeliefe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. Saints may do the Will of God unwillingly, if not againſt their will; <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was in bitterneſſe in the heat of his ſpirit, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to be a Prophet to this people, yet he went, <hi>I went: Jonas</hi> he goes to <hi>Ninive,</hi> but his heart is not full on the work, there was not a throughneſſe in it, he ſaw there was a neceſſity of it, God had power to puniſh diſobedience, and could quickly cruſh him, and therefore now in a prudentiall way, hee would go and propheſie to <hi>Ninive;</hi> there was in him an unwilling willingneſſe, his ſpirit was not totally willing, as you may gather from <hi>Chapt.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3. He was againſt the ſparing of <hi>Ninive;</hi> it ſtuck upon his ſpirit, that he ſhould lie under the imputation of a falſe Prophet; hee wiſhes death upon it, which ſhewes that his ſpirit was not wholly in the ſervice; wee do the worke and will of God oft times with great unwillingneſſe, as women part with their joyntures, or children;
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:123227:175"/> as Merchants throw their goods overboard in a ſtorm; as many now aſſeſſed part with their goods to the publique ſervice, neceſſity is too ſtrong for them, and prudence puts them on, and there's a willing unwillingneſſe; ſo it is with the godly, they pray and heare unwillingly, they give unwillingly, &amp;c. This is from the imbecilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of grace, the power of corruption, miſapprehenſion of God and his wayes, violence of temptations, intanglements with the world, preſſures of guilt, and unſucceſſefulneſſe of ſervice; let us be ſenſible of our unwillingneſſes in Gods wayes, be humbled for them, and ſtrive to do all <hi>animo prompto,</hi> Deut. 28.47, 48. <hi>Becauſe thou ſerveſt not the Lord thy God with joyfulneſſe and gladneſſe of heart, for the abundance of all things; therefore ſhalt thou ſerve thine enemies:</hi> it's good for us to have our wills and whole hearts in the works of God.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The infirmities of Gods people do not interrupt his love and grace; <hi>Ezekiel</hi> went in bitterneſſe, in heat of ſpirit, <hi>but the hand of the Lord was ſtrong upon mee.</hi> This great diſtemper in the Prophet did not diſtemper God; it did not cauſe him to retract or divert his love, but hee takes hold of him by his hand, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds him, as a parent would do to a childe, falling, or down, the weakneſſe or ſickneſſe of a childe doth not eſtrange the heart of the parent, it rather inlarges and drawes out the bowels more fully; and ſo it is with God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.13, 14. <hi>As a father pitieth his children, ſo the Lord pitieth them that feare him;</hi> and why ſo? <hi>Hee knowes our frames, hee remembers wee are but duſt;</hi> the Lord knowes what weak and frail things we are. The word for frame, notes a formed veſſell of earth, and the <hi>Chaldee</hi> expounds it, of our evill concupiſcence, which carrieth us into errour; God knowes that wee are earthen veſſels, full of luſts and infirmities, which lead us from him, which diſable us to ſerve him. Now here is the love, bowels, goodneſſe of a God, becauſe we are ſo, therefore he pitieth us: ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.37, 38. <hi>Their hearts were not right nor ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt with God, but God was right and ſtedfaſt with them, hee being full of compaſſion, forgave their iniquity, and deſtroyed them not;</hi> Infirmities may bring croſſes, but cannot cut off from mercies; this ſhould ſtrengthen our faith, comfort our hearts, and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage us with a holy boldneſſe to go to the Throne of Grace, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4.15, 16. Chriſt, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>is a mercifull high Prieſt,

                     </p>

                     <head>At the end of ſeven dayes.</head>
                     <p>It's probable the ſitting ſtill, and ſilence of the Prophet, was from Sabbath to Sabbath, on that day he had his glorious Viſion, and ſeven dayes after he had a new Revelation,<note place="margin">Junius.</note> The Word of the Lord came to him; all the ſix dayes hee was ſolitary, mourning, meditating, and ſilent, but on the ſeventh the Lord appeared again unto him; and ſo after hee had upon Sabbaths revelations from God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 1. That God beares with the weakneſſes and diſtempers of his ſervants; <hi>Ezekiel</hi> declines the Call of Chriſt, ſhew vs his great ingratitude, having had ſuch great favours from Chriſt, ſeen ſo much glory, and being commanded once, twice, to go and preach to the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet hee ſits down, is ſilent, and that ſeven dayes together; this might have provoked the Lord to great wrath, to have refuſed him, as a ſtubborn ſelf-willed man, and made him to ſay; hee would never admit him to be his Prophet, put ſuch honour upon him, intruſt him with ſuch great matters, but the Lord beares with his weakneſſe, yea, his continued weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: ſometimes Gods anger kindles, and breaks out quickly, and that for little things in our eyes and opinions; as the man gathered a few ſticks on the Sabbath, hee muſt be ſtoned to death; thoſe peeped irreverently into the Ark, the Lord ſmote 50000 and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward dead for it preſently, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> a ſmall matter in our conceits it was to keep back a portion of their goods, and to excuſe it with a lie; for this God was wroth, and they died, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. but the weakneſſes of his children hee beares with, and thoſe great ones.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Mans will and weakneſſe cannot hinder the efficacy and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of Gods decree; the Prophets ſpirit was againſt this work, he refuſed, ſate ſtill ſeven dayes together, and would have
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:123227:179"/> fruſtrated Gods intentions, if he could, but it was decreed in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that decree was efficacious, his will muſt be brought off, and he muſt be the man to execute Gods pleaſure in a propheticall way to the houſe of <hi>Iſrael; Jonas</hi> departs, will prejudice Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne concerning <hi>Ninive,</hi> but the Lord knew how to humble him, to fetch him back, being fled, and to make him inſtrumentall to his ends, notwithſtanding his wilfulneſſe and weakneſſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.9. <hi>He commanded, and it ſtood faſt,</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. <hi>The counſell of the Lord ſtandeth for ever;</hi> let there be contrary counſels, wills, commands, they ſtand not, Gods brings them to nought, hee makes them of none effect; <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.21. <hi>There are many devices in a mans heart;</hi> hee thinks not to do this, and not to do that, and it ſhall be ſo and ſo, <hi>nevertheleſſe the counſell of the Lord ſhall ſtand;</hi> he will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the work hee hath begun in men, and by men, notwihſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their infirmities.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Spirituall imployments muſt have ſedate, quiet, well-compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed affections and ſpirits; the Spirit of Prophecy came not upon <hi>Ezekiel</hi> all the time he was diſtempered and diſcontented, but when time had wrought off the diſtemper, and the il humor was digeſted, then was he ſtirred by the Spirit of prophecy: when the Minſtrell was tun'd, then the hand of the Lord came upon <hi>Eliſha,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 3.15. Mens hearts and ſpirits are like Minſtrells, out of order quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and long in tuning, and right ſetting; but the muſick is ſweeteſt when the Inſtrument is beſt ſet, then God delights to communicate his Spirit to us, to imploy us. In the night oft God appeared to the Patriarchs; then were they moſt quiet, and fitteſt to receive inſtruction. In <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his dayes, when there was peace through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the world, then was Chriſt given, then was hee born. When there is peace throughout the little world, then are wee apteſt for reception of Chriſt, his inſtructions, and readieſt for his ſervice; God will not commit weighty and great things to men, without due fitneſſe for them. The Prophet had this time deeply to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of the buſineſſe, and to get himſelf into ſuch a frame, as might beſt ſort with the Function he was to be in.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Lord doth not leave his long, although they be in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers; at the end of ſeven dayes the Word of the Lord came unto him; wee may by our failings and diſtempers drive away God from us, but he will viſit us again; hee may be gone all the
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:123227:180"/> week, but come again at the end of it; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.5. Gods anger is for a moment, our weeping for a night, and joy in the morning; it's not long this good Phyſician will be abſent from his Patient, and when he comes, he will comfort and cure.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Our Prophet brought not his own, but the Word of the Lord unto the people; it's his Word muſt be commended unto them; Prophets, Apoſtles, Miniſters, are his Ambaſſadours, and muſt ſpeak what is given them in Commiſſion: If they go or ſpeak of their own heads, they provoke God and wrong the people; <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.30. <hi>I am againſt the Prophets, ſaith the Lord, that ſteal my word every one from his neighbour;</hi> the falſe Prophets would take ſome ſayings of the true Prophets, and mingle them with their own lies and errours, to get the more credit unto them, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by falſe interpretations they would wreſt the Word to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh their own phantaſies; they would propheſie for their own glory and profit, and this was ſtealing of the Word; they did handle the Word <hi>alieno ſenſu, ſpiritu &amp; fine,</hi> then God or the true Prophets intended; ſo that their word was not conceived to be the Word of God, but their own, and yet they would faſten it upon God, <hi>verſ.</hi> 31. <hi>I am againſt the Prophets that uſe their tongues, and ſay,</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Tzopheh</hi> is from <hi>Tzaphah,</hi> to watch, to ſee from a high place, to look about on every ſide, to obſerve accurately; as in <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.3. <hi>The eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evill and the good,</hi> The word for beholding is <hi>Tzophoth,</hi> the ſame with that in the Verſe, and notes God exact and accurate eyeing of things; and it's metaphorically taken from thoſe that are ſet in watch-towers, whoſe office is to obſerve with the eye, and intention of minde, what danger is in preparation, approach, or execution, and to inform the city, town or army, to which hee is a watch-man, that all may timouſly look to themſelves. If any fire, robbery, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, invaſion, or danger whatſoever appeared, the watch-men were wont to give notice by ſignes or voyce, both in the night and day, and that conſtantly; ſuch was the Prophet to be here unto the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> hee was to fore-ſee and fore-tell the dangers were threatned, prepared, approaching, in execution; and this he was to do conſtantly, according to that in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 21.8. <hi>I ſtand continually upon the watch-tower in the day-time, and I am ſet in my ward whole nights;</hi> ſo <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.40.</p>
                     <p>There were two ſorts of watchmen God ſet in his Church; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, Prophets, Apoſtles, Euangeliſts; and ordinary, Paſtors and Teachers; theſe continue to this day, and theſe watch for the good of ſouls, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. and their office is as the Prophets, to learne of Chriſt, and to warn the people: the other are ceaſed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 1. The goodneſſe and bounty of Chriſt, that converſeth with, and communicates unto the ſons of men his precious truths and counſels; <hi>Son of man,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I have made thee, &amp;c.</hi> It
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:123227:181"/> had been honour to <hi>Ezekiel</hi> to have had an Angell conferre with him, and impart ſecrets to him; it's a great matter to have a Prince talk kindly to his ſubject, tell him his counſels and purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; what was it then for our Prophet, to have Chriſt, the Lord of Angels, and King of kings to ſpeak lovingly to him, to tell him of heavenly myſteries? And thus hee doth to us in his Word, that yet never ſaw his face, there he opens himſelf ſweetly to us, all things being written for our inſtruction.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It's Chriſts Prerogative to appoint watch-men in the Church: <hi>I have made thee a watch-man;</hi> hee might not make himſelf one; others without Chriſts Commiſſion and directions, might not have made him one; men ſhould not come into the watch-tower, except call'd, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.4. if hee do, hee will prove neither good watch-man, nor good work-man. Chriſt himſelf is the great Watch-man of the Church, he is the Head, and appoints who ſhall be in his ſtead; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. the Apoſtles were in his ſtead; ſo the Prophet here, ſo are all the faithfull Miniſters of the Goſpel, who are call'd mediately by the Church according to his will.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Miniſters of Chriſt muſt be men of knowledge; they are watch-men, and watch-men muſt have eyes in their heads, they muſt not be blind: in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.9. they are call'd <hi>Seers,</hi> if they have no eyes, they cannot be <hi>Seers,</hi> and if not <hi>Seers,</hi> not watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and then miſchief may befall the Church ſuddenly, and that without remedy; if the blind lead the blind they may both fall into the ditch; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.16. <hi>The leaders of this people cauſe them to erre, and they that are led of them are deſtroyed.</hi> Ignorance cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth error, and error deſtruction; therefore ſaid the Apoſtle to the Elders of <hi>Epheſus,</hi>

That the Church and people of God, the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> are ſubject to dangers, enemies, otherwiſe what ſhould a watchman need? cities, armies do not ſend out ſcouts and watchmen, if there were no enemies; where there is watching and warding, you may be ſure of it there is danger. The Church is like a ſhip, toſſed at ſea among rocks, ſands, with winds and waves, and needs the moſt skilfull Pilot to direct and ſteer it; it's like a Lamb among Lions, and needs the moſt watchfull Shepherd; they were in much danger in <hi>Babylon</hi> amidſt ſcoffing enemies, and the Church is not ſafe in <hi>Sion,</hi> her children are the Wheat, and the world threſheth them; they are the Vine, the Cluſters, and the wicked rend, preſſe, tear them; what is the colour of the Church but black? Schiſmes have ſo divided her, Errors ſo ſhaken her, Hereſies ſo toſſed her, and Perſecutions ſo battered her, that ſhee is black and blew, and hardly a ſound part left in her.

                     <p>What death is meant in this Verſe, is doubted among Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; whether the death of the body, or of the ſoul, or of both; the Ancients interpret it of the death of the ſoul, the ſoul of the wicked going on in his ſin, and of the Prophet neglecting his duty, ſhall die for it: ſome later Expoſiters would have it meant of the death of the body, ſome temporall judgement to cut them off by; but wee ſee many ill Prophets, that neglect to warn the wicked of their evill wayes, and many wicked men go on in their ſinfull courſes, and neither are taken away by temporall judgements: the young Prophet was ſlain by a Lion, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 13. becauſe he was leſſe faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full then he ſhould have been; and <hi>Jonas</hi> was caſt into the deeps, buried in the belly of a Whale, becauſe hee declined the ſervice of the Lord; but theſe were extraordinary acts and chaſtiſements, not <hi>vindictae,</hi> true, reall puniſhments.

The Lord Chriſt knowes who are wicked and vile; we gueſſe at men, and preſume oft wrongfully they are ſuch, but the Lord knowes who are ſuch in truth, and is not deceived; hee knowes the Goats and Swine as really as the Sheep and Lambs, hee can diſtinguiſh between the vile and precious, between his jewels and the reprobate ſilver, he never miſ-titles or miſcalls any, he knew the Scribes and Phariſees were hypocrites, and therefore call'd them ſo; hee knew that <hi>Judas</hi> was a Traytor,<note place="margin">Non eadem eſt ſententia tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunalis Chriſti &amp; anguli ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurronum, <hi>Jer.

                     <p n="2">2.

The life of man which is moſt deare to him is at the will of another; He ſpake with authority, when hee ſaid, <hi>Bring thoſe mine enemies that will not have mee to rule over them, and ſlay them before mee, Luke</hi> 19.27. When men are arm'd with power over our lives, they are much feared: Judges, when they go forth
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:123227:186"/> to keep Aſſizes, make Counties to quake; and Princes, when they go forth to war, make Kingdomes tremble. Now <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.10, 11. Kings and Judges are commanded to ſerve him with feare, to kiſſe him with ſubjection, leſt hee be angry, and command them to be ſlain, or tell them they ſhall die. If Kings and Judges that make others feare, muſt feare the Lord Chriſt, and ſubmit unto him, how ſhould all under them do it then? Chriſt knowes us, what we are, how we have ſinned, what wee deſerve, and can in a moment deſtroy us, or proclaim it our conſciences that wee ſhall die in our iniquities, and eternally ſuffer for them; It was hee awakened <hi>Judas</hi>'s conſcience, and ſet it on fire, let out his life, and ſent his ſoul to perdition; Be you great or ſmall, he is the Lord, he is ruler of the Princes of the earth, all power is in his hand; and though he be the Lamb of God, yet hee is alſo the Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> and can ſhake Kingdomes, conſciences with his voyce, let us feare before him.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. When Chriſt ſends Prophets and Miniſters, hee doth not denude himſelf of his power, and authorize them to condemne or abſolve at their pleaſure, they muſt depend upon Chriſt, heare him ſpeak, and ſay of the wicked, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſurely die;</hi> before they pronounce a man a dead man, a wicked man: their power is <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claratorie,</hi> and if Chriſt do not declare to them, they muſt not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare againſt others; <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.12. <hi>There is one Law-giver, who is able to ſave, and to deſtroy;</hi> Who art thou that judgeſt another? none have power to make or impoſe Lawes upon the good or the bad, but Chriſt, all others muſt have warrant from him, be they Princes or Prophets; and why? It's he that hath the power to ſave and to deſtroy, not they, and therefore it followes; Who art thou that judgeſt another? it's arrogancy and boldneſſe in any, to ſtep into Chriſts place, and impoſe any lawes, decrees, or inventions of men upon the conſciences of others, or to judge the conditions of men without warrant from Chriſt and his Word; Prophets may not do it, much leſſe others. Hence, what the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and all Miniſters ſay, muſt be examined, to the Law, and to the Teſtimony,<note place="margin">Iſa. 8.20.</note> if they ſpeak not according to this Word, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no light in them, no mourning, (ſaith the Hebrew) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt hath not appeared unto them, warranted them, and then their impoſitions and cenſures have no weight in them, and we may prudentially refuſe them.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>A righteouſneſſe of faith, Rom.</hi> 9.30. and this is in <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. <hi>the righteouſneſſe of God by faith;</hi> this is Euangelicall righteouſneſs.</p>

                     <p>But there is an outſide actionall righteouſneſſe before men, without reality within, and from this it's no difficult thing to turn aſide; and of ſuch <hi>a righteous man</hi> we may underſtand this place. The <hi>Chaldee</hi> expounds it ſo; <hi>Eos qui juſti videri volunt, permittam in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licum peccatum labi;</hi> thoſe that ſeem to be righteous, I will ſuffer to fall into open ſins. And the <hi>Scholiaſt</hi> refers a righteous man to the Prieſt, who hath Doctorall dignity, and ſeems to love vertue but doth not; and the ſoundeſt Interpreters agree in it: <hi>Calvin</hi> calls it a righteouſneſſe which hath <hi>externam ſpeciem tantum, non radicem;</hi> many have been zealous in the ſervice and Cauſe of God, and gone beyond others in promoting his glory, but have had no true root within; ſuch were thoſe promoted lately with much inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Prelaticall wayes and Innovations, but now are turn'd
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:123227:191"/> from their righteouſneſſe, and are become Parliament converts; their righteouſneſſe lay in opinion, not in reality, and ſuch is this here; and the Scripture ſpeaks frequently, after the opinions and conceits of men; <hi>I came not to call the righteous, but ſinners to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> The <hi>Phariſees</hi> were conceived by this world and themſelves to be righteous, when in truth they had none; and <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.12. <hi>The children of the kingdome ſhall be caſt out into utter darkneſſe;</hi> they were not ſo really, but in opinion, and externally.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Be it here meant a reall righteous man, whoſe inſide and outſide is ſuitable to the Law, blameleſſe; as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Zachary;</hi> yet hee that ſtands upon that foundation, <hi>viz.</hi> the Law, hee will ſlide from his righteouſneſſe: witneſſe <hi>Adam,</hi> who had a fuller righteouſneſſe then any of his ſons ſince, and yet hee turn'd away from it. The Law required two things; to depart from evill, and to do good; and he did the contrary, depart from good, and do evill; and in this he hath too many followers, all his children have traced thoſe ſteps; and men that not only ſeem, but are le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally righteous, may ſtill do it, the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter of this Prophecie is cleer for it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If it ſhould be granted that here is meant a man juſtified, righteous with the righteouſneſſe of faith, it followes not that hee muſt neceſſarily turn from his righteouſneſſe, loſe his faith, and be in an unjuſtified condition; <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8. <hi>If wee, or an Angel from heaven ſhould preach any other Goſpel unto you then what wee have preached, let him be accurſed.</hi> It cannot be inferred hence that an Angel will, or ever ſhall preach another Goſpel, it's 1500. yeers ſince this was writ, and no Angels have attempted any ſuch thing, nor ever will.

                     <p n="3">3. Apoſtaſie from God and his wayes is a dreadfull conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: when men fall from their righteouſneſſe, great miſchief is done, they ſtain the Society they were of, they blaſt the Church, they make their friends mourn, and enemies laugh; they wrong God much, yea, more then Infidels and Heretikes; <hi>Plura vincula con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctionis violantur, &amp; Deus ipſe tacite accuſatur quaſi iniquus,</hi> which cauſeth God to complain, <hi>O my people, what have I done unto thee! wherein have I wearied thee? teſtifie againſt mee; you are withdrawn, fallen to Idolatrous paſſages; I brought you out of Egypt, and ſent before you Moſes and Aaron, I delivered you from Balak, &amp;c.</hi> many ties are upon you to keep cloſe to mee, and to cauſe you to honour me, but you have forgotten all my kindneſſes, are gon away, and do ſleight me, as if Idoll gods and wayes were better then Jehovah and his wayes; this made God to ſay, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38. <hi>If any man draw back, my ſoul ſhall have no pleaſure in him;</hi> and what an ill condition is that man in, in whom God hath no pleaſure?</p>
                     <p>There be four great evils in the words of our Prophet:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>hee will commit iniquity;</hi> when a man turns from righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe he turns to ſin, imbraces it, ſerves it, walks in the wayes of
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:123227:194"/> it, and fulfils the ends of it, and this is a ſad condition; for ſuch a man is a worker of iniquity, and ſo hated of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Thou hateſt all the workers of iniquity;</hi> it's more then <hi>having no pleaſure,</hi> and notes God is againſt them, and will purſue them as enemies.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>God will lay a ſtumbling block before him;</hi> one thing or other, at which he ſhall fall; God denies him aſſiſtance, gives Satan leave to tempt and ſeduce, propounds objects to draw out his corruptions to the full;<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4.10.</note> 
                        <hi>Demas</hi> forſook <hi>Paul</hi> and the truth, and loved the preſent world, there was an object ſufficient to draw out his covetous diſpoſition; ſometimes the afflictions of the godly is a ſtumbling block unto the wicked, ſometimes the proſperity of the wicked is a ſtumbling unto them, &amp;c. It's a dreadfull thing when God ſhall make any thing a ſtumbling unto a man, but more dreadfull when he makes every thing ſo.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Hee ſhall die in that condition; Julian</hi> apoſtatiz'd, and by the ſtroke of God hee died in his apoſtaſie; and what heavier judgement, then to die in a mans ſinfull condition? therefore Chriſt told the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> they ſhould die in their ſins, <hi>John</hi> 8.21. they would not receive him, believe in him, therefore they ſhould die in their unbeliefe, and no place is left unto them for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>His righteouſneſſe which he hath done ſhall not be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred;</hi> If a man die, yet if his righteouſneſſe might follow him and help him, it were ſome comfort; but that ſhall not be thought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he loſeth all he hath done and ſuffered: Suppoſe he have done much for the Church, for poor Miniſters, priſoners, and other Chriſtians, for Truth it ſelf, and for the glory of God, no good ſhall come of it unto him now: All <hi>Adams</hi> righteouſneſſe would not advantage him, what ever he had done before, when he comes to eat of the forbidden fruit, hee muſt ſurely die, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. his former righteouſneſſe is forgotten; <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall keep the whole Law, and offend in one point, is guilty of all:</hi> Antecedent righteouſneſſe will not make up the preſent breach, nor prevent future wrath: <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.4. When the <hi>Galatians</hi> began to fall off, <hi>Paul</hi> intimates to them, that all their ſufferings would be loſt; have you ſuffered ſo many things in vain? When men in war for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their colours, and run to the other ſide, all the good ſervices they have done are forgotten, and they are accounted traytors to
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:123227:194"/> their Countrey and Cauſe; and ſo it is when men run from God and his Truth, to the worlds and Satans ſervice,<note place="margin">Lumb. l. 4. d. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>Inanis eſt poeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia quam ſequens culpa coinquinat.</hi> But this is not all, that his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe ſhall not be remembred for him, but it will be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred againſt him; 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21. <hi>It had been better for them not to have known the way of righteouſneſſe, then after they have known it, to turn from it;</hi> and why better? becauſe they now ſin againſt righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and that way they have affected and profeſt, and their righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe will be a witneſſe againſt them. Let us all take heed, leſt there be an evill heart in any of us, to depart from the living God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.12.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Mans ruine is from himſelf; he departs from his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, commits iniquity, and God layes a ſtumbling block; this in juſtice he doth, becauſe man hath ſinned; but who cauſes him to fall? not God, that is mans own act, he looks not to his way, it's his own luſt drawes him aſide, inticeth him, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.14. the cauſe is from within, only the occaſion is from without; riches, honour, friends, peace, credit, parts, beauty, truths, Chriſt, are the good and great bleſſings of God, and God in his wiſe diſpoſition of things, may lay theſe as occaſion of ſtumbling before us; but if we do ſtumble, that is mans, not Gods fault; <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.9. <hi>O Iſrael, thou haſt deſtoyed thy ſelf, but in mee is thy help;</hi> deſtruction is mans, ſalvation is the Lords. Man fell by his own free will, but if ever he be raiſed, it's by Gods free grace, and if God will not have mercy, he will turn their iniquity upon them: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.23. <hi>Hee ſhall bring upon them their own iniquity, and ſhall cut them off in their own wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;</hi> yet <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.32. it's ſaid, <hi>The turning away of the ſimple ſhall ſlay them, and the proſperity of fooles ſhall deſtroy them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. Gods proceedings with the wicked and godly are divers; Here he ſpeaks of laying a ſtumbling block before the wicked man; and in <hi>Jerem.</hi> 6.21. <hi>Behold, I will lay ſtumbling blocks before this people, the father and the ſonne together ſhall fall upon them: the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and his friends ſhall periſh;</hi> yea, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.14. God himſelf will be <hi>a ſtone of ſtumbling, a rock of offence to both the houſes of Iſrael, for a gin, and for a ſnare to the inhabitants of Jeruſalem:</hi> and <hi>Jerem.</hi> 46.6. <hi>They ſhall ſtumble and fall;</hi> but it's otherwiſe with the godly, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them he ſaith, <hi>Take up the ſtumbling block out of the way of my people,</hi> Iſa. 57.14. hee will remove what offends and indangers

                     <p n="6">6. An unfaithfull Miniſter is perfidious to God and man; <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou giveſt him not warning he ſhall die in his ſin, and his blood will I require at thy hands.</hi> God hath put honour upon the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, ſet him in a great place, made him a watchman, truſted him with ſouls, and hee now through ſloth, feare, inconſiderateneſſe, intanglements in the world, neglects to warn the ſinner; hereby ſouls are loſt, Satan robs God of them, is diligent to get and keep them, this will be treachery and ſacriledge too at laſt, and fall hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie upon him is guilty: if a band of men be ſlain through the Captains fault, or taken through falſhood, all cry out of it; and when ſouls periſh through the fault and falſhood of the Prophet, it's dreadfull;<note place="margin">Mont. in loc.</note>

                        <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. The <hi>Spirit</hi> is the great agent in divine things, it's the hand of the Lord that doth all; it beautifies with gifts and graces, calls to office, directs whither to go, what to do; it aſſiſts and inables to all divine operations. Chriſt had the chiefeſt work to do that concern'd the Church, and the hand of the Lord was upon him: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon mee;</hi> and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.2. it's a <hi>Spirit</hi> of might, and inabled him to do mighty things, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.19. And ſo <hi>Stephen,</hi> Acts 6.10. <hi>They were not able to reſiſt the Spirit by which he ſpake;</hi> it's the <hi>Spirit</hi> doth the great things in Religion, ſanctification and mortification are the works of this hand of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.2. <hi>Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto, &amp;.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ſervants of Chriſt have daily need of new influences of the Spirit to encourage them to, and ſtrengthen them in their work:
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:123227:197"/> 
                        <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was full of feares, had many diſcouragements, ſate in a doubtfull condition what to doe, and the hand of the Lord was upon him; he had formerly felt divine vertue, ſeen Chriſt, and heard him: yet all this doth not ſuffice, the hand muſt worke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and help him, elſe nothing will be done. The Apoſtles had been much with Chriſt, ſeen his miracles, heard his doctrine, and yet they muſt ſtay at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> till the Spirit fall upon them, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.4. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of himſelfe and others, <hi>Wee are not ſufficient of our ſelves to think any thing of our ſelves, but our ſufficiencie is of God,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. That is, all our ſtrength and help lies in him, wee daily finde a want in our ſelves, and God as it pleaſes him, lets out from his ſufficiencie unto us, now a little, and then a little, and we are ever receiving from him, and enabled by his grace and Spirit, to doe what is done;<note place="margin">

Thoſe things befell <hi>Paul,</hi> would not turne to his good, without the <hi>Philippians</hi> prayers, and further ſupply of the Spirit: as a weak houſe muſt bee under-propped, a ſickly man have daily help, an Army conſtant ſupply; ſo muſt the ſervants of God be under-propped, helped, ſupplied by the Spirit: Therefore we ſhould daily pray, as it is in <hi>Pſalme</hi> 68.28. <hi>Strengthen, O God, that which thou haſt wrought for us, and that which thou haſt wrought in us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. No place can keep off the hand of God from comming up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us: <hi>There at Telabib,</hi> ſhut up in his houſe, divine vertue ſeiſed upon him, he thought now to heare no more of propheſying, and doing publick ſervice of that nature to the Jewes, but the Spirit of God found him out, that cannot be excluded from any place, or limited to any time: It's like the winde that blowes where and when it liſteth: When the Apoſtles were ſhut up in a roome, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.2, 3. there was a ruſhing mighty winde, that filled all the houſe, and the Spirit with it, that filled all them. So when <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his company heard <hi>Peter</hi> preach in a private room, <hi>the holy Ghoſt fell on them all,</hi> Acts 10.44. As no place can include the Spirit of God, ſo can none exclude it. There were Saints in <hi>Neroes</hi> Court, and this hand of God had been working there; it's not a dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, any priſon can keep out the Spirit of God from comming to,
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:123227:197"/> and comforting of his ſervants: <hi>Glover</hi> found the truth of it when he ſaid, O <hi>Auſtin,</hi> he is come!</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The more ſeparate from the world, the more fit for commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God: <hi>Ezekiel</hi> muſt goe into the plain, and there the Lord would talk with him, hee could have converſed with him at <hi>Telabib,</hi> among the people in his own habitation; but the Lord declines that, intimating, that while we are conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant with worldly and wicked men, wee are incapable of divine myſteries; but when we are remote from them, ſolitary and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date, we are fitter to heare God ſpeake: When the Church was allured into the Wilderneſſe, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 2.14. then God would ſpeak, and that comfortably unto her. It was by the river <hi>Cbebar</hi> he had his former viſions, when he was abſent from popular noyſe, dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick troubles, his minde ſerene and contemplative, then the Lord opened himſelfe unto him.

                  <p>IF ought have need of opening in this verſe, it is <hi>the glory of the Lord,</hi> and there is no cloud upon this. The verſe expounds it ſelfe, it is the glory he ſaw before by the river <hi>Chebar;</hi> that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous viſion he had there, is repreſented again here unto the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet. The Viſion was not like the Temple, fixed to a place; but it was moveable, it was firſt preſented to him at <hi>Chebar,</hi> and now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in this plain.</p>
                  <p>The reaſons of this ſecond apparition of the glory of God, are:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, to poſſeſſe the heart of the Prophet with greater reverence of divine Majeſty, hee was unwilling to the ſervice called to by God, ſought excuſes, thought to decline it, which argued neglect of divine Majeſty to ſtrike out ſuch diſtempers, and to ſtrike in a deeper impreſſion of feare and reſpect to God. This glorious vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is ſet before his eyes, and frames him to a fitneſſe for that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment; he might now ſee Chriſt ſitting as Judge, compaſſed about with glory, having Angels ready to execute his pleaſure, power in and over all parts of the world; and if hee ſhould refuſe
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:123227:198"/> the imployment appointed, hee ran a manifeſt hazard of his life.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to confirme the truth of the Propheſie, and him in it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, to prepare the Church in all ages to an high eſteeme of this Propheſie, that was uſhered into the world with ſuch glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous viſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 1. Divine vertue makes men obedientiall unto the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God: The hand of the Lord was upon him, hee bids him goe forth; and preſently he aroſe and went forth into the plaine. If things enjoined ſuit not with our wills, opinions and humours, we deny them, excuſe and take off our ſelves from the doing of them, or deferre them; but let God enjoyn what hee will, bee it harſh to fleſh and blood, contrary to our wills, carnall reaſon, &amp;c. if divine vertue once come upon us, and the Spirit move in us, wee will doe it; God bid <hi>Abraham</hi> take his ſonne, his onely ſonne <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac</hi> whom he loved, goe and ſacrifice him upon a mountaine in the land of <hi>Moriah, Gen.</hi> 22. Fleſh and blood had much to object here; but becauſe hee was acted by divine vertue, therefore hee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed preſently, he roſe early, took his ſonne, went to the place, ſtretched out his hand to ſlay him, and to make him a Sacrifice; we ſtick oft at ſmall things when nature only workes, not at any thing when the Spirit of God works in us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are obedient to God ſimply upon his command, meet with mercies unexpected: <hi>Ezekiel</hi> goes forth upon command, not knowing what was to come, what was to be done, and hee meets with an extraordinary mercy, he ſaw the glory of the Lord, a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing, a ſatisfying mercy. <hi>Abraham</hi> obeying the command of God, heares the voyce of an Angel twice, and meets with a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of bleſſings, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.17. <hi>In bleſſing I will bleſſe thee, and in mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying I will multiply thy ſeed as the ſtarres of heaven, and as the ſand of the ſea ſhore, and thy ſeed ſhall poſſeſſe the gate of his enemies, and in thy ſeed ſhall all the Nations of the earth be bleſſed, becauſe thou haſt obeyed my voyce.</hi> So <hi>Jacob</hi> returned from <hi>Laban</hi> to his fathers houſe upon divine command, and he meets with Angels, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.1. hee met with God, and like a Prince prevailed with him for a bleſſing, verſ. 28. No man ever loſt by his obedience unto God; though we ſee no reaſon for things, yet if we have the will of God that's reaſon
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:123227:198"/> enough; let us be tractable and forward to do the will of God, and wee ſhall not loſe our labour, wee may meet with mercies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected, as ſome by coming to the Ordinances have done.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. See the goodneſſe of the Lord in two things:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in that hee will manifeſt his glory to the view of mortall ſinfull creatures; his glory is precious, a hidden thing, and not obvious to creatures; yet here, as before, he is pleaſed in a Viſion to preſent it to the ſight of <hi>Ezekiel:</hi> it was to the Ambaſſador of a Prince that <hi>Hezekiah ſhewed the houſe of his precious things,</hi> Iſa. 39.2. and it was a great favour to let them ſee ſuch rarities; it was a greater favour from God to let <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſee this rarity of rarities, his Glory.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that God ſhould act over the ſame thing again, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the ſame Viſion in living creatures, wheels, eyes, firmament, a throne, and one ſitting upon it, and give a ſight of his glory the ſecond time; this ſets out Gods goodneſſe abundantly; men are unwilling to do the ſame thing twice, when as they may do it better the ſecond time then the firſt, and advantage themſelves by it, but God hath no advantage, doth it perfectly at firſt; yet ſimply for mans good, he condeſcends to do the ſame thing again. So <hi>Ezekiel</hi> may be brought to a fitneſſe for divine diſpenſations, incouraged too, and in his work he ſhall have a ſight of glory, and a glorious Viſion preſented to him the ſecond time by Gods own hand; wee think repetitions of things in vain, a Sermon twice over is ſtale, unwelcome, oft neither Miniſter nor people find any ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in it, and ſo of other things; but God repeats the Viſion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudice to himſelf, or damage to the Prophet.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Sin makes us uncapacious of happineſſe; it's mans happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to ſee the glorious God, and have communion with him. While <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood, he could behold God, converſe with him in his glorious appearances unto him, but after his fall, he fled from his preſence, was diſabled, and incapacious of the ſight of him and his glory; ſo here, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> cannot abide the ſight of this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Viſion, but falls down upon his face, and hides himſelf from his own happineſſe: till ſin be purged out of us, it will be ſo; therefore God hath appointed purging ordinances, that we being purified, might at laſt ſee him, and have fruition of him. Two things eſpecially are required to the ſight of glory, Holineſſe and
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:123227:199"/> Strength, to both which ſin is oppoſite, it defiles, it infeebles, ſo that we dare not, we cannot behold glory; ſee what miſchiefe ſin hath done us.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Apprehenſions and ſight of glory doe much humble graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hearts: When <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſaw the glory of the Lord, he fell upon his face: the glory of a creature raiſes a carnall heart, but the glory of the Creator humbles a gracious heart. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.14. <hi>We beheld his glory as the onely begotten of the Father;</hi> and this made <hi>John</hi> the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Prophet that ever was borne of a woman, to be ſo low in his own eyes, that he profeſſed himſelfe <hi>unworthy to looſe the lachet of his ſhooe,</hi> ver. 27. There be ſome things in the ſight of divine glory, that works ſtrongly to humble the ſoule.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It is of that luſtre and excellency, as that it darkens all the glory of the world, and makes it ſeeme no more then the luſtre of a Glow-worme to the Sunne.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It ſets out the ſhamefulneſſe and blackneſſe of ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Inſufficiency of all humane motions and duties to attaine unto it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Shews the infinite diſtance between God and the creature.</p>
                  <p>All which are humbling things, and concurring doe humble more throughly, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was not onely amazed, doth not onely fall downe, but falls upon his face, and that after a ſecond ſight of the ſame glory; ſo that it's in the nature of glory to humble; other things may humble a little, but glory moſt of all: that comes by the eare doth ſomething, but that is ſeene by the eye affects moſt. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> had heard the Seraphims crying, <hi>Holy, holy, holy, the earth is full of his glory;</hi> but this ſtruck not ſo deeply into his heart, as the ſight of glory; when he ſaw the King, the Lord of Hoſts in his glory, then he cryed out, <hi>woe is me, I am undone;</hi> his holineſſe was nothing, his propheticall office was nothing, all was nothing to him, he was an undone man, he ſaw ſo much ſinne in himſelfe; <hi>I am a man of uncleane lips, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>BEing in a dejected condition the Spirit entred.

The entring of the Spirit notes, not onely thoſe, but the ſanctifying of a man, ſo that he ſhall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy his gifts and graces to the glory of God, and eternall good of his own ſoule. Of the Spirits entring and ſetting the Prophet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his feet I ſpake in the 2. <hi>Chap. ver.</hi> 2. It was not the ayre, his own ſpirit returning, nor an Angel, but the Holy Spirit of God. This entrance of the Spirit notes, not motion from place to place, for the Spirit is infinite and fills heaven and earth, but it notes operation, manifeſtation, impletion; when the Spirit doth work efficaciouſly, manifeſt it ſelf, (for there may be inviſible operations) fill the heart of any with divine vertue, when it doth any one of theſe, or all theſe, it's ſaid to be ſent, to come, to enter; it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted the Prophet, being amazed, ſunk in apprehenſion of his own unworthineſſe, and manifeſted its operation by ſetting him upon his feete, giving new ſtrength to goe and propheſie when time ſhould ſerve.</p>

                     <p>Theſe words are not ironically ſpoken, or by way of Sarcaſme, becauſe he had formerly ſhut up himſelfe, but they are a command from God to the Prophet; it's true, by reaſon of the rebellious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the people, the weightineſſe of the calling he was to be in, and the infirmitie of the fleſh, he had withdrawne from his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and God beares with him, bids him withdraw from the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick view; <hi>Jerome</hi> thinks this ſhutting up was a type of the beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Citie, that as he ſhould be ſhut up in his houſe, ſo the <hi>Jewes</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Others thinke more probably, that it was to receive inſtructions from God, and to heare from him before he ſhould ſpeake ought to the people, therefore ſome obſerve that our
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:123227:200"/> Prophet heard and ſaw much, and ſpake not till the end of the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                        <hi>Chap.</hi> 23. <hi>verſ.</hi> where he ſaith, <hi>Then I ſpake unto them of the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivitie, &amp;c.</hi> This ſhutting up made way for the credit and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the Prophet and his propheſie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 1. The Spirit affects and viſits an humble ſoule: When the Prophet was humbled with the ſenſe of his owne unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, trembled at the ſight of glory and majeſty, was deſtitute of ſtrength; then it pleaſed the Spirit of God to enter: humiliations upon ſight of glory and greatneſſe are deepeſt, and the Spirit loves to viſit them ſpeedily; God doth not long leave humble ſoules without operations and manifeſtations of his Spirit. <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.6. <hi>He reſiſteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble,</hi> he ſends the Spirit into their hearts to comfort and ſtrengthen them, becauſe they are low, vile in their own eyes; but deſtruction is for the proud, God is in battaile array againſt them; the Spirit appeared like a dove, and is a dove of the valleys, not of the mountains; while <hi>Paul</hi> was a mountaine in his owne eyes, the Spirit never came neere him, but when he was humbled with the ſight of glory, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. even the glory of Chriſt, and became a valley, then quickly the ſpirituall dove tooke her flight to him, for <hi>ver.</hi> 17. ſaith <hi>Ananias, Brother Saul, the Lord hath ſent mee that thou mighteſt receive thy ſight, and be filled with the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> the Lord Jeſus would not let him want his Spirit to revive him, that was ſo effectually humbled at the ſight of his glory.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The godly before Chriſt, had the ſame Spirit, grace, and comforts that wee have ſince Chriſt. <hi>Ezekiel</hi> had the Spirit enter into him; What Spirit? Even the Spirit of God and Chriſt, the third Perſon in the ſacred Trinitie; neither doth that in <hi>John</hi> croſſe this truth, <hi>The Holy Ghoſt was not yet given, becauſe that Jeſus was not yet glorified,</hi> Chap. 7.39. Not given at all is not the meaning, but was not given ſo plentifully, ſo viſibly, till Chriſt was glorified. You know that Kings when they enter their Kingdomes firſt, or ride in triumph after great Victories, then they ſcatter gold and ſilver plentifully, and give the greateſt honours and gifts unto men: So Chriſt reſerved the powring out of his Spirit in ſuch plenty and inviſible ſignes, till his glorifying; therefore <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets had not another Spirit who foretold Chriſt to come;</hi> but this is meant of that manner of giving which appeared not at all before.
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:123227:200"/> They under the Law had not the Spirit given in that way and ſo largely, but they had the ſame Spirit, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. and <hi>Luke</hi> 1.41.67.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Spirit of Chriſt which the godly receive, is not a Spirit of bondage, but of comfort, of grace and freedome; this Spirit did not ſtraiten the Prophet but enlarge him, he was impriſon'd with his own feares, beate downe under ſenſe of his owne worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſſe; but this Spirit of Chriſt did ſet him at libertie, and lifts him up againe, and works graciouſly in him; this Spirit is oft call'd the <hi>Comforter,</hi> and that emphatically, becauſe no man, no Angel, no Ordinance doe or can comfort like the Spirit, it helps againſt feares, ſinnes, guilt, temptations, ſtraitneſſe of heart; this made the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is libertie,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.17. It knocks off bolts, locks, ſhackles; it makes way for his owne graces to act, and act with livelineſſe, and if there be ſtrong holds within, ſtrong luſts that oppoſe, it's a Spirit of power, and will carry all before it. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7. <hi>God hath not given us the Spirit of feare, but of power,</hi> ſuch power as will conquer all the rebellions of a mans will, bring all into order, captivate every thought unto Chriſt, and make a man able to doe the whole will of God, an <hi>Ezekiel</hi> to propheſie to a rebellious people, and to venture his life amongſt them.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Thoſe Chriſt ſends unto the Church, he gives his Spirit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: <hi>Ezekiel</hi> hath the Spirit enters into him before he enters upon his office: men voyd of the Spirit are not meet to be Church-offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; all things in the Church come under ſpirituall conſideration, the people are to be profeſſors of holineſſe, ordinances are holy, and what ſhould unholy officers doe there? if <hi>they have not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt, they are none of his,</hi> and what ſhould they doe in the Church of Chriſt? he will aske them one day; Friends how came you in hither? I ſent you not.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Spirit performes what Chriſt promiſeth: In the 22<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                        <hi>verſe,</hi> Chriſt bids the Prophet goe forth into the plaine, and tells him he will there talke with him, but being come thither, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit entred into him, and ſpake with him. Chriſt and the Spirit are one in Eſſence, one in will, and one in operation, ſo that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet was not deceived, but it was the ſame as if Chriſt had ſpoken to him, <hi>I will be with you to the end of the world,</hi> ſaith Chriſt; his
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:123227:201"/> Spirit was with them, and ſo in that it was made good that <hi>he was with them;</hi> the Spirit makes good what ever the Lord Jeſus hath promiſed, when it comes, and it cannot be otherwiſe; for theſe three, <hi>Father, Word,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> are one, and agree in one, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.7.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. There is a language of the Spirit within a man: <hi>The Spirit entred into mee, and ſpake with mee;</hi> How it ſpeaks is hard to make out unto you. Wee have heard that the Devill hath ſpoken in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties bewitched and poſſeſſed, and you have text of Scripture for it, <hi>Act.</hi> 19.13, 14, 15. <hi>When the ſonnes of Sceva adjured the evill ſpirit in the Name of Jeſus, the evill ſpirit anſwered, Jeſus I know, and Paul I know, but who are yee?</hi> Thus did the Devill expreſſe himſelfe in the poſſeſſed; and ſurely the Spirit of God can ſpeak vocally in thoſe where it dwells, but that is not the ordinary language of the Spirit. A man ſpeaks to another, <hi>Quando conceptum mentis alteri manifeſtat,</hi> and as the Schools ſay of Angels,<note place="margin">Halenſ.</note> they ſpeak <hi>manifeſtando ſuum voli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> ſo we may ſay, the Spirit ſpeaks unto us by manifeſtation of its minde unto us. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.13. <hi>What the Spirit ſhall heare, that ſhall be ſpeake, and he will ſhew you things to come:</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of mine, and will ſhew it unto you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. The proceedings of God with his own ſervants are various and darkſome; the Prophet was bid to preach oft before in the 22. <hi>verſe,</hi> he is called forth into the plaine, and when he is there the Lord bids him goe and <hi>ſhut himſelfe up in his houſe,</hi> as it is in this 24. <hi>verſe.</hi> Now he will have him propheſie, and preſently he ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends him from his office and libertie, neither is there any change in God, but he by theſe various diſpenſations fulfills his eternall counſells.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. God conſiders the weakneſſes of his ſervants, beares with, and provides well againſt them: <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was timorous, the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> rebellious, and like enough to offer violence to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, if he ſhould have preſently propounded the dreadfull judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God that were at hand againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and therefore he takes care of him, and commands him to ſhut up himſelfe, that ſo he might be ſafe, and not at firſt be diſcouraged at the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the people, or weightineſſe of his worke; God is full of bowells and tenders his, when put upon difficult imployments.</p>

                  <p>In the Metaphoricall ſenſe take it thus; The Jewes cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure thee, nor thy prophecy, they are ſo bitter, ſo rebellious, obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and ſet againſt thee, that they will not ſuffer thee to look out of doores, and come among them, they decline thee and thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, they will not endure either of them, and ſo thou art as a priſoner and man in bands; not that he had any materiall bands
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:123227:202"/> upon him, but was bound up in this ſenſe; their ſinnes were the Prophets bonds; and we may take up this obſervation from it; That peoples ſinnes doe impriſon and imbondage the ſpirits of the Prophets, and ſo hinder the courſe of the word. This <hi>Paul</hi> knew, and therefore requeſts the <hi>Coloſsians</hi> to pray, <hi>That God would open to him</hi> and others <hi>a doore of utterance,</hi> Col. 4.3. that they might not be ſtraitned in the work of their Miniſtery; Mens ſinnes doe ſilence the Miniſters, and ſend them to priſons; if you look not well to it, your ſinnes may quickly make this good.</p>
                  <p>I incline to the literall ſenſe, and then it's doubtfull who bound the Prophet; <hi>They ſhall put bands, &amp;c.</hi> Not the Angels; though God uſe them in the Government of the world, yet we finde not that God uſes them to binde his Prophets. Some conceive it to be his friends and familiar acquaintance, and that it was done in love; if others had done it, they would have left him in cuſtody other where, then in his own houſe; but without prejudice to any I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it came from the people, who either bound him, or beſpake his binding. And my ground for it is this; He is made a Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> in that capacitie and relation the Lord ſpeaks unto him; here is no mention of any domeſtick friends, but of the people, it was they without, not they within; as is cleare from the words, <hi>They ſhall put bands upon thee, and thou ſhalt not goe out among them.</hi>

                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 1. Chriſt deales fairely, not fraudulently with his, he tells them at firſt what they muſt expect, not gold and ſilver, but bands and chaines, <hi>They ſhall binde thee.</hi> He told <hi>Jeremy,</hi> they ſhall <hi>fight againſt him,</hi> Jerem. 1.19. So <hi>Paul</hi> no ſooner is called to preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but he heares of ſuffering, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.16. <hi>I will ſhew him how great things he muſt ſuffer;</hi> and <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.9. Chriſt tells all the Apoſtles, that they muſt be afflicted, hated, killed; and this he doth in faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, love, and wiſdome, that they might not be deceived in looking for other kinde of entertainment in the world; that they might not have hard thoughts of him for hiding away ſuch things from them, that they might be confirm'd againſt ſuch evills when they fell out, and remember it was no more then the Lord foretold them of, <hi>Job.</hi> 16.2. <hi>They ſhall put you out of the Synagogues; yea, they ſhall kill you, and think they do God good ſervice:</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 4. <hi>Theſe things have I told you, that you may remember I told you of them when the time comes.</hi>

                     <pb n="375" facs="tcp:123227:202"/>2. No excellency exempts a Prophet from the malice of mens tongues and hands; <hi>Ezekiel</hi> is immediately call'd and ſent by Chriſt, ſees extraordinary Viſions, hath much converſe with Chriſt, is fill'd with the Spirit, yet all this keeps him not out of bands, they ſpake evill of him, and bound him. Chriſt himſelf was all excellency beauty, goodneſſe, yet theſe preſerved him not out of the hands of malice; there's nothing will ſatisfie it, but mens liberties and lives, malice feeds on ſuch dainties.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The generality of people are enemies to their own good, and active to their own ruine: the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> they are againſt the Prophet, they fetter and chain him up, and think they have done well, to make him ſecure from coming amongſt them; and alas, what have they done? thruſt away the phyſician ſhould cure them, ſhut out mercy by ſhutting up a Prophet, put out the light; and now are there not droves and multitudes of people that would think it a happineſſe to get all the Prophets ſilenced, impriſoned, baniſhed, if not more? they would live in darkneſſe, and die in darkneſſe, and ſo undo themſelves for ever. Chriſt the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, the people, after all his precious Sermons and glorious mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, cry, <hi>Away with this man, Crucifie him, crucifie him,</hi> Luke 23.18, 21. They had cryed <hi>Hoſanna</hi> formerly, but now the time being turn'd, they turn againſt Chriſt: there be many that ſhew ſome kindneſſe outwardly to the Prophets, but inwardly they are againſt them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Wicked ones deal ſeverely, cruelly with the Prophets, when they fall into their hands; they put bands, not one or two, but many bands upon <hi>Ezekiel;</hi> and they were wreathed, twiſted, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie, thick bands, ſuch as might not only hold, but hurt and pain the Prophet: when <hi>Ahab</hi> had got <hi>Micaiah</hi> into his hands, he ſends him to priſon, and commands him to be fed with bread and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of affliction, that is, with ſo little and ſo unſavory, <hi>ut longam potius mortem trahat, quam vitam ſuſtentet,</hi> hee would kill him, <hi>non brevi morte, ſed lenta fame. Jeremiah,</hi> the Princes are wroth with him, ſmite him, put him in the priſon, <hi>Jer.</hi> 37.15. yea, into the dungeon where he ſunk into deep mire, and had periſhed, if <hi>Ebed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech</hi> an <hi>Ethiopian,</hi> had not been more propitious to him, then his own countreymen the <hi>Jewes</hi> were, <hi>Jer.</hi> 38.6, 7. <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Antiq. 10.</note> they put him into a muddy pit, <hi>ut ibi praefocatus moreretur,</hi> which
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:123227:203"/> might eaſily have been, for he was <hi>uſque ad collum merſus;</hi> others think they aimed not at his preſent death, but thought, <hi>paedore &amp; fame,</hi> lingeringly to conſume him: <hi>Peter,</hi> when he fell into <hi>Herods</hi> hands, he was bound with two chaines, <hi>Acts</hi> 12.6. You may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſomething in that verſe; there is a priſon, chains, ſouldiers, keepers, all theſe mentioned in it; which ſhew the ſeverity of <hi>Herod.</hi> A bare priſon had been too much for ſuch an Apoſtle, but he muſt be chain'd, and with two chaines; and for feare he ſhould get out of his chaines, hee muſt be between two ſouldiers, which probably were more afflictive to his ſpirit with their oaths, &amp;c. then the iron was to his body; and leſt hee ſhould get from theſe, there was alſo the keepers at the dore, watching. <hi>Paul</hi> tels you how he was handled by wicked men: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23, 24. <hi>In ſtripes above meaſure, in priſons frequent, in deaths oft; of the Jewes five times received I forty ſtripes ſave one, thrice beaten with rods, once ſtoned, thrice ſhipwrackt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Afflictive conditions ſeldome better mens ſpirits, they were in <hi>Babylon</hi> under captivity, and five yeeers paſſed in that condition, <hi>Chapt.</hi> 1.2. and yet their proud hearts not humbled, their old en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the Prophets not worn out, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.15, 16, 17. God ſent them meſſengers, Prophets, and they mocked them, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed them, till the wrath came, and there was no remedy; and therefore he brought upon them the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> who led them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to captivity, where they were ſervants and ſlaves; their wronging of the Prophets was the cauſe of their ſuffering, and yet all their ſufferings did not ſubdue their ſpirits, and work them to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the truth, and walk peaceably towards the Prophet; they bind him in the land of bondage: the Plough breaks the earth in many places, but doth not better it, but leaves it as it was, nothing is put in by the Plough; if the Maſter dung it, and ſow good ſeed in it, when the Plough hath broken it, then there is like to be a harveſt, but if nothing be ſown, weeds, nettles, thorns will grow where the Plough hath been; and ſo afflictions may break our eſtates, our bodies, our ſleep, yet if nothing be added, if God do not ſanctifie them, the harveſt will be tares, and not wheat.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It's no new thing for Prophets and Miniſters to be roughly intreated, and laid by as uſeleſſe things: <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 400. yeeres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt, is ſhut up, bound, kept from coming among the
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:123227:203"/> people, and this miſery hath befallen the Prophets in ſeverall ages, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 18.4. <hi>Jezabel</hi> cut off the Prophets, and then they were hid by fifties in caves; <hi>Jeremy</hi> was ſhut up in the priſon in the Kings Court, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.2. moſt of the Prophets and Apoſtles were reſtrained from their publique imployments, ſhut up in priſons, baniſht or driven into corners, and that proves oft a great ſadding to ingenuous ſpirits, not ſo much in that they ſuffer, but becauſe they are out of imployment, but let thoſe are in ſuch conditions, or may ſhortly be, conſider it's no ſtrange unwonted thing, ſuch afflictions have been formerly, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.9. <hi>The ſame afflictions are accompliſhed in your brethren that are in the world;</hi> beſides, God hath need of no men, nor any of their parts.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe the Prophet is bid in the the next Chapter, <hi>verſe</hi> 9. to prepare him meat, and to eat thereof, which he could not do, if his tongue had cleaved to the roof of his mouth; the motion of the tongue is needfull to that action.</p>

                     <pb n="378" facs="tcp:123227:204"/>2.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 1. The Lord hath the power over Prophets lips, to ſhut and open them at his pleaſure: <hi>I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, &amp;c.</hi> If God forbid the Prophets to ſpeak, they muſt be dumb, as contrary, if hee command they cannot be ſilent: <hi>Amos</hi> 3.8. <hi>The Lord hath ſpoken, who can but propheſie?</hi> The <hi>Jewes</hi> objected againſt the Prophets, that they propheſied no good unto them, only ſad things, and were meſſengers of death; the Prophet anſwers, it's true, but God hath commanded, hee hath ſpoken, and who can be ſilent? who ſhall dare not to deliver and heare his meſſage? he is a roaring Lion, will tear in pieces diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient Prophets and people, he was to ſpeak, and to be ſilent when God would have it ſo. <hi>Balaam</hi> knew this, <hi>Numb.</hi> 22.38. <hi>Lo, I am come unto thee, O Balak; have I now any power at all to ſay any thing?</hi> can I with canning do any thing? ſo is the Hebrew; <hi>the word that God putteth in my mouth, that ſhall I ſpeak;</hi> it was in God to open or ſhut his mouth; hee could not with all his canning do ought: <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.1. <hi>The preparations of the heart in man, and anſwer of the tongue is from the Lord;</hi> and ſo the ſilence of the tongue, and ceſſation of the ſpirit in man, is from the Lord; Prophets are to be ſilenced and ſuſpended, not when Prelates, people will, but when the Lord will.</p>

                  <p>This Chapter hath in it theſe parts:</p>

                  <p>I ſhall begin with the typicall beſieging of the Citie; the <hi>Jewes</hi> that yet lived at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> truſted in their ſtrength and priviledges, were ſecure, fearing no dangers; they accounted them fooles and weak ones, who had yeelded themſelves into the hands of the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonians,</hi> and becauſe <hi>Jeremiah</hi> had counſelled them to doe it, and prophecied hard things againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> they dealt roughly with him, and got him impriſon'd; Here therefore the Lord ſet our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet a work to lay ſiege againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to batter it with warlike inſtruments, that ſo the captives with him might not repent them
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:123227:207"/> of what they had done, nor thoſe at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> put off any longer the evill day; cry, Peace, peace, when deſtruction was at hand.</p>

The Lord deals with his people not only by his Word, but alſo by ſignes and types; here is a <hi>Tile,</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> pourtraid upon it; here are forts, mounts, tents, rams, iron-bands, all which typed out Gods dealing with <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and in this language God had oft expreſſed himſelf: by the Rain-bow in the heavens God ſpeaks to the world, Circumciſion, the Paſchall Lamb, the High prieſts Garments, the ſtones in <hi>Aarons</hi> breſt, the ſprinkling things with blood, did all ſignifie and type out ſomething to the people; ſo <hi>Jeremiahs</hi> ſeething pot, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. his linnen girdle, and bottles with wine, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. the Potters veſſell, <hi>Chap.</hi> 19. the basket of figs, <hi>Chap.</hi> 24. and yokes of iron, <hi>Chap.</hi> 28. and ſo all the Parables in the old and new Teſtament, they utter forth the minde of God. God hath throughout his Word abundantly expreſt himſelf this way; and the Lord doth it, becauſe types and figures make truth more evident and efficacious. The Word affects the eare, types and figures affect the eye, and carry a greater efficacy with them then ſimple and plain ſpeech. The Parable of the barren fig-tree, loſt ſheep, prodigall ſon, ten virgins, &amp;c. had much life and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in them; ſo when Chriſt took a little childe and ſet before his Diſciples, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. it wrought more effectuall upon them then many words, and left deeper impreſſion in them; wee may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſee the goodneſſe of the Lord in it, that affords us ſuch helps in his Word as may affect our hearts moſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That the Lord knowes things to come, and reveals them at his pleaſure; hee knew that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhould be beſieged by <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar,</hi> and diſcovers it unto the Prophet, and cauſes him to make a draught of it: which ſhewes a difference between the true God and all others; they cannot foreſee and foretell things to come, are not Gods, but the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> can fore-ſee things, though afar off; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d abilities; he fore-told the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> the
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:123227:209"/> 
                        <hi>Egyptian</hi> and <hi>Babylonian</hi> captivity, and times of both; there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing future hid from God, we know not what ſhall be to morrow, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.14. but God knowes what ſhall be to morrow, next yeere, yea, hundreds and thouſands of yeers hence, if time be ſo long, and this proclaims him to be God, even the only true God: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.21, 22, 23. God calls there to other gods, to bring forth their reaſons, whereby to prove their divinity, let them ſhew what's paſt, and things that are to come, and then hee will take them for ſtrong reaſons, and acknowledge them gods with himſelf; but to tell things paſt and things to come, can none but the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and they to whom he reveals them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Gods appointment and authority makes things and actions mean and ridiculous in the eyes of the world, to be weighty and of great uſe: It ſeems to carnall reaſon a childiſh thing, that the Prophet ſhould take a <hi>Tile,</hi> draw the City upon it, make forts, mounts, warlike engines to batter it, yea, to take <hi>a pan of iron</hi> and ſet between him and the city; <hi>theſe</hi> men of the world are apt to look at as ridiculous, much like the practice of boyes in a ſnow, that make forts, mounts, &amp;c. in ſport; but be not deceived, what the infinite wiſe God commands, is of great concernment, how mean ſo ever the things and actions about thoſe things appeare, the legall worſhip if you look upon it in it ſelf, ſeems ſtrange that they ſhould kill ſo many beaſts, burn them to aſhes; that the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, and things belonging to it, ſhould be ſprinkled with blood; that they muſt refrain from ſuch meats, be unclean if they touch ſuch things, that they muſt be circumciſed, eat a paſchall Lamb, &amp;c. I ſay, if wee look at them externally, they ſeem irrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall things, but if wee eye God commanding them, they had an excellency, and were of great uſe to them, and inſtruments of much good; now <hi>bread, wine, water</hi> in Baptiſme, and the Supper of the Lord ſeem mean things, and ſuch they are, as are common to the world, but Chriſts appointment to uſe theſe, makes the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, that gives <hi>dignitatem &amp; pondus,</hi> ſo that they are of great vertue to them that rightly partake of them; the Pope and his Prelates have commanded and brought much into the worſhip of God, <hi>Quicquid poterat diſiderari ad eximium ſplendorem;</hi> but it's fooliſh, unſavory, unprofitable, and efficacious only to make void the Ordinances and Commands of God; and why? becauſe the
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:123227:209"/> Lord never commanded ſuch things; that is contemptible in the eye of man, being commanded of God is honourable and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, when that is pompous, decent, honourable in the eye of the world, being not commanded of God, is deſpicable, fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and frivolous.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. God is an enemie to ſinfull Cities; he bids the Prophet lay ſiege to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and to batter it; hee commands the ruine of a City, is an enemie to that Citie; <hi>Ezek.</hi> 5.8 <hi>Behold, I, even I am againſt thee, ſaith the Lord; Jeruſalem</hi> was once beloved, it was <hi>Gods reſt and deſire,</hi> Pſal. 132.13, 14. <hi>a faithfull city;</hi> Iſa. 1.21. <hi>a holy ctty,</hi> Iſa. 52.1. <hi>the city of the Lord;</hi> Iſa. 60.14. but now it was become an harlot, full of murthers, the Princes of it were rebellious and companions of thieves, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.21, 23. the ſins of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> were very great; you may reade largely of them in the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> where you may find, that <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> ſins and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations exceeded <hi>Sodomes</hi> and <hi>Samaria's,</hi> ſhe juſtified them in their abominations, they were little, not the half of <hi>Jeruſalems;</hi> and therefore this made the Lord to ſay, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.31. <hi>This City hath been to me as a provocation of mine anger,</hi> or, <hi>for a provocation of mine anger, and of my fury, from the day that they built it, even unto this day, that I ſhould remove it from before my face:</hi> there was no rank of men but had greatly provoked him, <hi>Kings, Princes, Prieſts, Prophets, men of Judah, and Inhabitants of Jeruſalem,</hi> verſ. 32. and therefore God was reſolved to deſtroy it, and to make it a curſe to all nations, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 26.6. and pronounced a wo to it in <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.1. where yee farther ſee what a City <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was now become, and what her citizens were. <hi>Wo to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppreſſing city; She obeyed not the voyce, ſhe received not correction, ſhe truſted not in the Lord, ſhee drew not neer to her God; Her Princes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in her like roaring Lions; her Judges are evening Wolves, they gnaw not the bones till to morrow; Her Prophets are light and treacherous perſons: her Prieſts have polluted the Sanctuary, they have done violence to the Law, the juſt Lord is in the midſt thereof, &amp;c.</hi> And in the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, <hi>their cities are deſtroyed, ſo that there is no man, no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant.</hi> Sin makes God to lay waſt great Cities; <hi>Tyre, Sidon, Sodome, Gomorrah, Babylon, Jeruſalem,</hi> felt the ſtroke and ſtrength of Gods wrath.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Nothing ſecures a ſinfull city from ruine; let it be ſtrongly

                     <p n="6">6. The ſins of a people and city may be ſo provoking, at ſuch a heighth, that neither God nor man will ſhew mercy to them. God bids him ſet an iron pan between him and them; ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that both himſelf and the army that hee ſhould bring, would be as iron to them; they had iron hearts and necks, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48.4. and would not yeeld to God, and now he would be ſo to them, and cauſe their enemies alſo to be ſuch; God would ſet his face againſt them, and the faces of their adverſaries. Great ſins make God inexorable ſevere; <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.13, 14. <hi>When the Land ſins grievouſly, I will ſtretch out my hand, and cut off man and beaſt; and though Noah, Iob and Daniel were in it, they ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver but their own ſouls;</hi> all their prayers, tears, righteouſneſſe, intereſt in God ſhould extend no farther then themſelves. God now had ſhut his eyes, and would not look upon them; he had ſtopt his ears, and would not heare them praying, nor others for them, hee was ſet againſt them, reſolved to puniſh them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no miſeries, no complaints, no ſufferings of the living, or groans of the dying could prevail with him; and when the army came, it uſed them ſeverely enough.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The Lord ſends out his Declarations before he cauſes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions: this ſhall be a ſign to the houſe of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> God ſteals not upon men by publique judgements before they heare of them, but tells them of their coming while they be at ſome diſtance. The Prophets heare of them, and they proclaim and diſcover them ſome way or other; this fact of the Prophets would quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpread and be at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and ſo might be a warning unto them; God ſends out the lightning before hee thunders, hee frownes before hee ſmites, and gives tokens of his coming in wrath before he executes it.</p>

                  <p>IN theſe Verſes the Prophet proceeds in the typicall beſieging of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and the words declare to us the duration of the ſiege, which was to be many dayes, and the cauſe of it, their iniquity.</p>
                  <p>The word <hi>Iniquity</hi> notes here, not ſin, but the puniſhment of ſin, and in that ſenſe it's oft uſed in ſacred language; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.6. <hi>The Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all;</hi> that is, the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our ſin; and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.27. <hi>adde iniquity unto their iniquity;</hi> that is, <hi>puniſh their iniquity;</hi> puniſhment is an inſeparable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of ſin, and therefore it hath the name of ſin. And the Prophet was <hi>to beare their iniquity;</hi> that is, the puniſhment of it; this he did repreſentatively, by this act of lying <hi>upon his ſide</hi> ſo long, ſetting out the longſuffering of God, who had born with the ſins of this people, and not puniſhed them as they deſerved; our Prophet did not here repreſent Chriſt, who bare our iniquities, but at the command of God hee ſuſtained the perſon of the ten Tribes and kingdome of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and therefore it's ſaid, verſe 5. <hi>I have laid upon thee the yeers of their iniquity;</hi> I have appointed thee by lying on thy ſide ſo many dayes, to repreſent the time they have offended mee by their Idolatries and ſins attending the ſame, and ſo to ſet out my patience, and aggravate the puniſhment of their ſin: Chriſt bare the ſins of men to take away the puniſhment of it; the Prophet, to increaſe the ſame.</p>
                  <pb n="393" facs="tcp:123227:211"/>
                  <p>For our better underſtanding of theſe <hi>Hieroglyphicall</hi> paſſages in the verſes read, we ſhall make inquiry into ſundry things:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Whether our Prophet did in the literall ſenſe lie ſo many dayes upon his ſide, or was it only in Viſion?</p>
                  <p>Some make it reall, and ſay <hi>Ezekiel</hi> did lie upon his ſide all the dayes are mentioned, although hee ſlept not all the time, yet he lay in that poſture, and that it was by ſpeciall help of God, if na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could not of it ſelf reach unto it; yet it's related of a Noble man of <hi>Lonaim,</hi> who lay ſixteen yeers in one poſture, <hi>viz.</hi> with his face upwards; and <hi>Pradus</hi> ſaith, he ſaw a mad man which had lien upon one ſide fifteen yeers: <hi>Theodoret</hi> thinks he lay bound all this time, and felt moſt grievous pain, that ſo hee might repreſent the great miſeries of <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> ſiege, which ſuffered great famine.</p>
                  <p>This opinion hath many and great Authors; yet I muſt joyn with thoſe who are for the Prophets viſionall lying on his ſide: for beſides that nature could not bear it; how ſhall we clear the juſtice of God, that ſhould for the Idolatries and ſins of others, which former Prophets had reproved, ſo greatly afflict and puniſh one innocent?</p>
                  <p>Again, he was to prepare himſelf bread, <hi>verſe</hi> 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of this <hi>Chap.</hi> he was to ſet his face againſt the mountains of <hi>Iſrael, Chap.</hi> 6. v. 2. and if hee lay ſtill all theſe dayes on his ſides, how could either of theſe be done? It's alſo ſaid in the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                     <hi>Chapt.</hi> v. 1. <hi>In the ſixt yeer, in the ſixt moneth, in the fift day of the moneth, as I ſate in my houſe, and the Elders of Judah before me, the hand of the Lord God fell there upon me;</hi> if <hi>Ezekiel</hi> did in the letter lie ſo many dayes, the time was not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired; for the Prophet had his firſt viſion in the fifth yeere of the captivity, the fourth moneth, and the fifth day, <hi>Chapt.</hi> 1. v. 12. and ſeven dayes after this viſion he had another, <hi>Chapt.</hi> 3. v. 15. which made it the twelfth day of that moneth, and on that day he was commanded to lie on his ſide; and if you reckon from thence, you will find not above 413. as <hi>Pradus</hi> reckons it, or 418. and then if you joyn the days the Prophet lay on his ſide, they amount to 430. So it will then appear the Prophet had twelve or ſeventeen dayes to lie on his ſide when the Text ſaith, <hi>he ſate before the Elders,</hi> this lying therefore is to be taken viſionally, not really.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What the lying on the left ſide points out unto us; and why the iniquity of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is laid upon that ſide. There is ſome
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:123227:212"/> myſterie in it, and the opinions of men are different: ſome make the reaſon of it to be the ſituation of <hi>Samaria,</hi> which was the head city of the ten Tribes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7.9. and this city was on the left hand of <hi>Jeruſalem, Ezek.</hi> 16.46. and thereupon the Prophet lay on his left ſide, to repreſent them and their ſins, and on his right to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the houſe of <hi>Judah</hi> and their ſins: but beyond this, there is ſomething to be taken hold of, and it's this; the left ſide or hand notes diſreſpect; the right ſide or hand, dignity or favour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.34.41. the good were on the right hand, the bad on the left. By this poſture of the Prophet, is typed out to us the different reſpect of God to the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah;</hi> the ten Tribes were leſſe deare to God then the other; they had grievous ſins, and God would ſhew them leſſe mercy, deal with them as thoſe at his left ſide; but for <hi>Iudah,</hi> whoſe ſins was as great as theirs, yet God would chaſtiſe with leſſe ſeverity, hee would not take away his loving kindneſſe from <hi>Iudah,</hi> though he did from <hi>Iſrael, Iudah</hi> was at his right ſide, and God would in his diſtribution of ſorrow and wrath remember mercy.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Whom we are to underſtand here by the houſe of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> the ten tribes which are uſually ſo call'd in the Scripture, were carryed into captivity 130. yeeres before by <hi>Shalmaneſer,</hi> in the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> yeere of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18.9, 10. To what end therefore ſhould they be brought in here, under a typicall ſiege of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> when they ſinn'd not at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and if they had, were now gone, and under the ſeverity of God?</p>
                  <p>Some take the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be meant diſtinctly of the ten Tribes; and this lying of the Prophet on his left ſide not to refer to <hi>Ieruſalems</hi> ſiege, but to the ſins of the Tribes, and the patience of God towards them; others include the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the houſe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and ſo make not the Prophets literall lying to look at the ten Tribes in captivity, but at thoſe of them who were joyn'd to the houſe of <hi>Iudah;</hi> for when the great rent was by <hi>Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam,</hi> all of the ten Tribes did not cleave to him; and many that at firſt did, afterwards ſeeing the evill of his Idolatrous wayes, withdrew from him, and cloſed with the houſe of <hi>Judah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 11.16, 17. when they ſaw what <hi>Jeroboam</hi> intended, <hi>thoſe that ſet their hearts to ſeek God, came to Jeruſalem to ſacrifice, and ſtrengthened the kingdome of Iudah;</hi> and in <hi>Aſa's</hi> dayes, many fell to him out
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:123227:212"/> of <hi>Ephraim, Manaſſeh,</hi> and <hi>Simeon,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.9. yea, in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; <hi>Aſa</hi> being a good King, they came flocking to him, and willingly ſate down under his ſhade: It's more then probable alſo, that when <hi>Shalmaneſer</hi> came out againſt <hi>Samaria,</hi> and carryed away the Tribes, that many fled to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and the parts there-about; for it's ſaid, in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.6. <hi>that they eſcaped out of the hands of the Kings of Aſsyria;</hi> and in the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, that divers of <hi>Aſhur, Manaſſeh, and Zebulon humbled themſelves, and came to Ieruſalem;</hi> this was to receive the Paſſeover, and then they returned to their poſſeſſions in their own cities, <hi>Chap.</hi> 31.1.

That God beares with the ſins of his people, though great, a long time, and forbeares the puniſhment due to them: three hundred and ninety yeers did he ſuffer them, which marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly commends to us the patience of Cod; they provoked him daily, moſt bitterly, and did evill as they could; <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12.1.14. and <hi>Ierem.</hi> 3.5. yet God held his peace and his hands for hundreds of yeers; and therefore ſaith in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.14. <hi>I have a long time holden my peace, I have been ſtill, and refrained my ſelf:</hi> If God had not power in him to puniſh, his ſuffering with ſinners ſo long were not ſo much; but God hath power enough to be avenged on all the ſinners of the earth; he could cruſh them as a moth in his hand, every moment; he hates ſin with a perfect hatred, and yet he bears with notorious ſinners, with all ſinners and ſins, deferring the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of them, ſometimes a long ſeaſon; ſo that he is not only patient, but longſuffering; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.20. <hi>The longſuffering of God waited in the dayes of Noah, while the Ark was a preparing;</hi> What did it wait for? even their repentance: <hi>Noah</hi> preached unto them of the flood, warn'd them by preparing of an Ark, and God expected they ſhould amend and turn to him, and it was an hundred yeers at leaſt he waited upon that generation; and now, <hi>the Lord is long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.9. <hi>to us-ward, not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance;</hi> if we will not repent of our ſin, God will repent of his longſuffering, his wrath will kindle, and we ſhall periſh, be inexcuſable, and have the deeper condemnation for abuſe of his longſuffering.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

<pb n="402" facs="tcp:123227:216"/> ſinfull wayes they ſeldome return, but proceed, adding ſin to ſin, filling up the meaſure of their iniquities; <hi>Ieroboam</hi> makes a rent, layes a foundation in Idolatrous practices, and the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> continue in that way three hundred and ninetie yeers, not one king of <hi>Iſrael</hi> right. <hi>Solomon</hi> he goes out by the inticing of his wives, to falſe worſhip, he corrupts <hi>Iudah,</hi> leavens it w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Idolatry, and not all the good Kings in <hi>Iudah</hi> could get out that leaven again perfectly; if there were a ſtop of Idolatrous paſſages made in one Kings raign, there was liberty granted in anothers. Idolatry and other ſins ſo abounded in <hi>Ahaz, Manaſſes</hi> and <hi>Zedekiah's</hi> dayes, that the Lord was weary of them, and not quiet till he had rejected them. And this is not only ſo in States and Churches, but alſo in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular caſes: if men fall into any way of wickedneſſe, ſo corrupt is nature, ſo prone unto ſin, that it perſiſts unto its own perdition, rather then returns to its own ſalvation; it muſt be a mercifull and powerfull hand of God that reduceth a ſtraying ſinner, much more a ſtraying State.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That length of time is no good plea for errors; falſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, ſinfull cuſtomes and practices, they could plead hundreds of yeeres for their high places, Calves, <hi>Samaritan</hi> Rites, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, Prieſts, &amp;c. yet antiquity would not exempt them from guilt and puniſhment; he muſt bear the iniquity of the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they had ſinned in the direction, uſe and retention of theſe, and God had viſited, and would yet viſit more for them: what if wee have had Prelacy and Popery, Ceremonies and Superſtitious Rites among us hundreds of yeers? they are plants not of Gods planting, and through age ſo rotten, that they need plucking up, and it will be his honour whoſe ſhoulder and ſtrength is imployed that way.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Lord ſhewes more favour to his, ſinning great ſins, then he doth to others that are not his; the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> hath the left ſide, is <hi>Loammi</hi> none of Gods people, and therefore utterly rejected, ſent into captivity, and return not; the Houſe of <hi>Iudah</hi> hath the right ſide, God would ſhew them favour in their captivity, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn them after ſeventy yeers correction in <hi>Babylon;</hi> Gods car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage towards his, is different from that towards others: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.30, 31, 32, 33. <hi>If his children forſake my Law, and walk not in my judgements; if they break my Statutes, and keep not my Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, then will I viſit their tranſgreſſion with the rod, and their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

                  <p n="6">6.

                  <p n="7">7.

Great mourning; ſhaving off the hair was uſed in that caſe, <hi>Job</hi> 1.20. when all the ſad accidents were reported to <hi>Job, he rent his mantle, and ſhaved his head;</hi> which was a ſign of great mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: So <hi>Ezra,</hi> the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. when the <hi>Jewes</hi> had defiled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with ſtrange women, hee pluckt off the hair of his head and beard, and ſate down aſtoniſhed, ſee <hi>Iſa.</hi> 15.2. <hi>Jer.</hi> 48.37.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Great diſgrace; ſo when <hi>Hanan</hi> ſuſpected the meſſengers <hi>David</hi> had ſent unto him, hee ſhaved off half their beards, which was a great reproach, and vindicated with the ſword, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. When men are without hair on their heads or faces, it's a reproach to them; hence the boyes mockt the Prophet, and call'd him bald-pate, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2.23.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Deſtruction; when hair is cut off it falls to the earth, and periſheth; and when people are cut off from God, they periſh, God would ſeparate them from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> from his worſhip, from his preſence, and ſo they ſhould fall to the earth, be as filth, and come to nothing.</p>
                     <p>The next think conſiderable, is the weighing of the hair.</p>
                     <p>Ballances are an embleme of Juſtice, and ſets out here the great equity of God in diſpenſing of his judgements; he is exact in them, even to a hairs weight, his judgements are not too light or too heavie, but have their juſt weight and meaſure.</p>
                     <p>The diviſion of the hair followes; and that notes out the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of their conditions; they ſhould not all fare alike, but the judiciary providence of God would proceed, with ſome in one kinde, with ſome in another.</p>
                     <p>A third part was to be burnt in the midſt of the city.<note place="margin">Verſ. 2.</note> It may be queſtioned what city, he being now in <hi>Babylon:</hi> it was the city pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed upon the Tile, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.1. which was <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> What is meant by fire is doubted; fire in Scripture, oft notes out great ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities: as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.12. <hi>We went through fire and water;</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.12. <hi>Think it not ſtrange concerning the fiery triall;</hi> and here ſome underſtand fire in a metaphoricall ſenſe, for famine and plague, whereby a third part of the citizens died; others take it literally, and conceive hereby is repreſented the burning of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> of

                     <p>Another part was to be ſmitten with a knife, that ſets out thoſe were to be cut off by the ſword, either in the ſiege, or after it, as 2 <hi>King.</hi> 25.4, 5, 6, 7. and not only thoſe in the city, but all in the regions about it.</p>
                     <p>After this, a third third part was ſcattered into the wind, which notes their diſperſion into ſeverall parts, as hair before the wind is carried ſome one way, ſome another; ſo were theſe <hi>Iewes</hi> ſcattered, ſome into <hi>Moab,</hi> ſome into <hi>Ammon,</hi> ſome into <hi>Egypt;</hi> and <hi>Iohannan</hi> carried divers thither, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 43. but God threaten'd them with a ſword, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 42.16. and 44.27. and made it good when <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar</hi> conquered <hi>Egypt,</hi> which is propheſied of in the 46. of <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> God drew out a ſword, and ſent it after them.</p>

That wicked men are of little worth: take a whole city of them, they are of no more account with God, then a little hair of the head or beard: hair in it ſelf is an ornament, but when it groweth burthenſome, off it goes, and is rejected as a thing of nought; ſo inhabitants are a glory to a city, but when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come wicked they are a burthen to it, to God, he will cut them off and value them no more then a little hair: <hi>Abſalom</hi> cut off his hair when it was heavie, but hee prized it very high, at two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſhekels, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.26. God cut off the hair of the head of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> it was very heavy, but he prized it not; wicked men, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes, millions of them, are not worth a hair, they are inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable worthleſſe things, all the wicked of the world are but excrements in it, which muſt be cut off and thrown unto the dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hills; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.17. <hi>The wicked ſhall be turned into hell, and all the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that forget God.</hi> Take the beſt thing of the wicked, it's of ſmall price, ſome farthing matter; <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.20. <hi>The heart of the wicked is of little worth;</hi> his cloaths, his ornaments and jewels, his eſtate, and houſe and land may be of great worth, but himſelf, his very heart is of little worth, not accounted of in heaven. But now take the meaneſt thing of a godly man, it's valued, regarded, <hi>the hairs of his head are all numbred,</hi> Matth. 10.30.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It's the priviledge of Chriſt to appoint whom and what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments he pleaſe to execute his pleaſure upon ſinners; <hi>Take thee a ſharp knife, a razor, and cauſe it paſſe upon thy head and beard;</hi> the Prophet might not take what inſtrument hee pleaſeth, but what Chriſt appointeth; it was he ſet apart <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan,</hi> and the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> to ſhave <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and therefore the whole work is given to God: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7.20. <hi>The Lord ſhall ſhave with a razor that is hired by them beyond the river, by the King of Aſsyria, the head and the hair of the feet, and it ſhall alſo conſume the beard;</hi> this is ſpoken of <hi>Senacherib,</hi> and verified alſo in <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> both theſe were razors in the hand of God, by which he ſhaved the head, the

It's the Lord appoints and ſets inſtruments on work to afflict Churches and States; <hi>Amos</hi> 3.6. <hi>Shall there be evill in a city, and the Lord hath not done it?</hi> there is no razor ſhaving in a city, but the Lord hath ſet it on work there, <hi>Micah</hi> 1.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. When God hath been long provoked by a people the comes with ſharp and ſweeping judgements amongſt them, and that is ſet out by the razor: he had waited much upon them, they went on in their ſins, but now God calls for a razor, and that ſhould go to the quick:<note place="margin">Muſcul. <hi>in</hi> Iſa.</note>

                     <p n="4">4. That there is no ſtanding out againſt God, what ever our number or ſtrength is, his judgements are irreſiſtible: men here are compared to hairs, his judgement to a razor; can the ſofteſt or harſheſt hair withſtand the razor? can any one or all the hairs of the head or beard do it? no, the razor will eaſily paſſe through all, as a fithe through graſſe or corn: hairs are weak things, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zors ſharp and ſtrong; <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was the ſtrength of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but God by the red Sea did ſhave him, and many thouſands more from off the face of the earth; the great men of the world are no more to God, then hairs before the razor, he cuts off the ſpirit of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76.12. he challengeth the briers and thorns of the earth,

Some underſtand here the lawes of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, what men have written in their hearts naturally, according to what you finde, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14, 15. and the <hi>Jewes</hi> that had the laws of God ſuperadded to the law of nature, did not abſtaine from thoſe ſinnes the Nations did; They obſerv'd the Law the <hi>Jewes</hi> brake.</p>
                     <p>Others referre it to their laws, decrees, and practiſe, touching their gods, and the worſhip of them, they were tenacious of both, and would not alter their worſhip, nor exchange their gods.

That God walkes not into the way of judgements, till men doe walke out of the way of his ſtatutes; <hi>Becauſe yee have not walked in my ſtatutes, nor kept my judgements,</hi> therefore I will doe ſo and ſo by you; God's delights are in wayes and works of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; Judgements are his ſtrange works, and ſtrange acts, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.21. he is provoked unto them as a Bee unto ſtinging; it's the child's wantonneſſe cauſes the father to uſe the rod. <hi>David's</hi> ſin brought the ſword to his owne houſe, the plague to the people; when the wickedneſſe of the earth was great, then the windows of heaven were open, and the flood came, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.</p>

God calls the wrath his wrath, and <hi>Shiſhach</hi> was to powre out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Jeruſalem; Shiſhach</hi> was the vial, God put in the wrath, and powred it out at his pleaſure. <hi>Amos</hi> 4.6.10.

                     <p>The word <hi>Mikdaſh</hi> notes ſometimes a holy place for refuge, and referres to God himſelf; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.14. <hi>Hee ſhall be for a Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary;</hi> here it notes the Temble, the place of Gods worſhip, from <hi>Kadaſh</hi> to ſeparate and conſecrate to divine uſe; the Sanctuary or Temple was conſecrate,<note place="margin">Schindl.</note>

                     <p>I ſhall ſpeak a little of the holineſſe of places, becauſe there is an opinion in the world, that ſome places are holy, and that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties done in them are better then done elſewhere. It was the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a great Prelate,<note place="margin">B. A.</note> that God heard prayer, <hi>Non quia precatur, ſed quia ibi,</hi> becauſe the prayers were in ſuch a place.</p>
                     <p>Two wayes places become holy:
<list>
                           <item>Firſt, by divine preſence.</item>
                           <item>Secondly, by divine inſtitution.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the firſt, when God did in a viſible extraordinary way ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt himſelf and his glory in any place, this made it holy, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. when Chriſt was transfigured in the mount, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent glory appeared; this made the place holy, and the Apoſtle call'd it <hi>The holy mount;</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. So Gods appearing to <hi>Moſes</hi> in the buſh, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.5. made that place holy, ſuch appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of God are not now.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond way is by inſtitution and appointment from God; when the Lord doth depute and conſecrate places to holy uſes, then are they holy, as the Temple was, God appointed the place, the building of the Temple, the dedication &amp; conſecration thereof; its onely God can make any thing holy, none but he that made the creature, can lift it up to a higher condition then 'twas ſet in
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:123227:239"/> at firſt; no man can make perſons, things, times, places, holy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Lord. Now the Temple was by the inſtitution of God ſo ſanctified, that it was a type of Chriſt, a part of worſhip, a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full meanes of grace, giving acceptation to the perſons, and all the duties of worſhip there done; ſo that it was a ſin for them to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip elſewhere, or to divert the Temple to any other uſe; We have no extraordinary appearance of God to make places holy, nor any conſecrated by divine inſtitution to type out Chriſt, or any ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall thing to be a part of worſhip, a means of grace, making the worſhippers and worſhip more acceptable; and therefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive we have no place holy; it was not the Temple, but the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues that reſembled our publique places of worſhip, and they were not holy; <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.17. <hi>They ſcourged in their Synagogues;</hi> and that was no holy act;<note place="margin">A Lapid. Brugenſ.</note> it's the judgement of learned ones that <hi>Paul</hi> had his five whippings, of which he ſpeake in the 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24. in the Synagogues; they had the Word preached in them, <hi>Job.</hi> 18.20. <hi>Act.</hi> 15.21. as it is in theſe publique places, yet that did not make them holy, and priviledge them from common acts of Juſtice; the holineſſe of places under the Law was ceremoniall, and Chriſt hath put an end to ſuch holineſſe; the difference of places he hath taken away, and no one is more holy then others, <hi>Job.</hi> 4.21. <hi>The houre is coming,</hi> ſaith Chriſt to the woman, <hi>when you ſhall neither in this mountaine, nor at Jeruſalem worſhip the Father;</hi> it's true, now there is holineſſe in theſe places, the men and their ſervices are more accepted here then any where elſe; but the houre is at hand, that all ſuch reſpects ſhall be taken away, and all places made alike, and you and your ſervices ſhall be as acceptable in every place of the world, as at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Hence is it that <hi>Paul</hi> puts men upon praying every where, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8. Many thinke their prayers better in ſuch a meeting-place as this, then in their cloſets, then in the fields; but they are deceived, places now adde no efficacy or accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to mens prayers; it's rather prayer, Ordinances, and ſo the ſpirituall preſence of God in them that makes places holy; and this is the Argument that ſome ſtick upon; but upon examination, this will not make the publick place of meeting more holy then others; for <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.20. it's ſaid, <hi>Where two or three are gathered, &amp;c.</hi> be it in a ſhip, a private houſe, a field, if gathered together in his Name, he is in the midſt of them, he is there not for the place, but the
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:123227:240"/> peoples ſake; yet no man judicious accounts all places holy where ſpirituall duties are doing, or after they are done; and why pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick places of worſhip ſhould be ſo accounted of in time of worſhip or after, is not diſcernable to a religious and judicious eye; of old the Altar ſanctified the gift, it's not ſo now.</p>

If you referre it to jealouſie, it notes out Gods taking them into covenant to be his people; their revolt by Idolatry and other ſins, and Gods jealouſie upon it, who grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hot with diſpleaſure, ſpake ſharp and dreadfull things againſt this people, as a jealous husband would do againſt an adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous wife.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 1. That God goes on by degrees in his wrath againſt a people, he did not accompliſh his anger and fury at firſt, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan with leſſer judgements, but at laſt came up to a perfection; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had whipt them with ſcourges, now hee would do it with Scorpions; he had formerly done much, vexed them with wars, famine, plague, but never laid waſte their city, ruin'd their Temple, ſcattered them into the four winds, as now he would do; hee had in times paſt corrected them like a father, he would now exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute them like a Judge, the drops of his wrath had done no good, now they ſhould have the full vials, all the wrath conceived againſt them ſhould be inflicted, accompliſhed.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That wrath let out againſt a ſinfull people, oft times lies long upon them; <hi>I will cauſe my fury to reſt upon them,</hi> they were 70. yeers under Gods diſpleaſure in <hi>Babylon;</hi> Gods wrath hath been upon the <hi>Jews</hi> that rejected the Goſpel theſe 1600. yeers they would not be under the bleſſing of Chriſt, they are under the curſe of God, his wrath abides upon them; Gods anger and fury hath reſted upon <hi>Germany</hi> above twenty yeers; theſe kingdomes of <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> are under it; fervent prayer is requiſite, that God would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move his wrath, and not let it reſt upon us. It's a dreadfull thing to have ſettled plague or war amongſt us; The Barons wars in King <hi>John's, Henry</hi> the third's, and <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond's dayes, made ſad times, Gods wrath reſted then for a long ſeaſon upon this kingdome, the choyceſt blood of it was let out, and it brought a deplorable condition. Let us repent and reform, that wrath may not reſt upon the kingdome; and let us believe, that wrath may not abide upon us; <hi>John</hi> 3.36. <hi>He that believes not, the wrath of God abideth on him:</hi> man came into the world a childe of wrath, an heir of wrath, Chriſt is a remedy propounded for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movall of that wrath, if men believe not, the wrath of God abides ſtill on them, goes along with them, and will eternally ſink them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. God takes pleaſure in executing judgement, in accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:123227:245"/> his wrath, and cauſing his fury to reſt upon impenitent and incurable ſinners he will be comforted in it: <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.26. <hi>I will laugh at your calamity;</hi> God would bring calamities upon them, juſt judgements for the ſetting at naught his counſels, refuſing his reproofs, and rejoyce in them; for as judgements are ſatisfaction to divine juſtice, they are delightfull unto God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.32. in every place where the grounded ſtaffe ſhall paſſe which the Lord ſhall lay upon him, it ſhall be with Tabrets and Harps: when God ſhould deſtroy the <hi>Babylonians</hi> and <hi>Aſsyrians,</hi> it ſhould be with delight, which the Tabrets and Harps expreſſe, which were muſicall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, uſed in wars and victories, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.20. And when God executed judgement upon ſpirituall <hi>Babylon, Rev.</hi> 18.20. it was with joy; therefore the Spirit of God calls for it, <hi>Rejoyce over her, thou heaven, and yee holy Apoſtles and Prophets, for God hath avenged you and himſelf on her alſo,</hi> which was a comfort and eaſe, a delight to God; hence judgements in Scripture are term'd his pleaſure; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 46.10, 11. <hi>I will do all my pleaſure: Calling a raven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous bird from the Eaſt,</hi> and <hi>Chap.</hi> 48.14. <hi>Hee will do his pleaſure on Babylon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Word of God may be preached among a people, and they through ignorance and malice, not know it, nor entertain it; <hi>they ſhall know that I the Lord have ſpoken it;</hi> they conceived not that it was the word of God which the Prophets delivered, they thought them to be no more then other men, and their word hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, and therefore ſleighted it; there was much affected ignorance in them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.11. <hi>it's a people of no underſtanding;</hi> Jer. 4.22. <hi>My people are fooliſh, they have not known me;</hi> and as many were blind, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were malicious againſt the Prophets and their meſſages they brought from God: <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.16. <hi>As for the words which thou haſt ſpoken in the name of the Lord, wee will not hearken unto thee, but wee will do whatſoever thing goeth forth of our own mouth;</hi> Chriſt came and preached to his own, and they received him not, they neither knew him nor his doctrine, or if they did, they malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly rejected both.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That wicked men ſhall be convinced, and left without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe; <hi>they ſhall know that I the Lord have ſpoken,</hi> they eyed men and not me, they deem'd it mans voyce, not heavens, but they ſhall find that it was the voyce of God amongſt them; and what can men ſay, when God hath ſpoken, and hath not been hearkened unto?
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:123227:246"/> every mouth will then be ſtopt; they would not know, but they ſhall know; they would not own my truths, but they ſhall feel my judgements, and when they are upon them, then will they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Prophets and their words, which will be as burning coals in their boſomes; then they will ſee what deſperate revolts they have made from God; how they are beſieged with his power, and cannot eſcape the ſtroke thereof; when men ſhall ſee it's the infinite, great and glorious God that they have ſleighted, in the Prophets, in the Ordinances, then they will be ſtruck dumb, and fall under the wrath of that God.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. God will juſtifie his ſervants in their zealous labors for him: <hi>They ſhall know that I have ſpoken it in my zeal;</hi> it's God ſpeaks in the Prophets; it's his zeal they expreſſe; let men be zealous againſt ſin, the iniquities of the times, they are counted mad, fiery fellows, troublers of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſeditious, factious, &amp;c. <hi>Paul</hi> was a zealous man, and not only <hi>Feſtus</hi> an Heathen counted him mad, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.24. but even the Chriſtian <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.13. thought him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides himſelf; and ſuch conceits had the people of Chriſt, who was a man of zeal, they thought him too hot, that his zeal was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his judgement, <hi>Mar.</hi> 3.21. they plainly ſaid he was beſides himſelf; <hi>Michal</hi> ſcoft at <hi>David</hi> as one of the fools for his zeal. Let the world paſſe what cenſure it will upon Gods Miniſters, God will juſtifie thoſe who are ſincerely zealous, and count their zeal his zeal.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. That the Lord is intenſe, and will not recall his indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when he deals with unfaithfull, covenant-breaking perſons; as in Gods zeal there is intenſe love towards his Church (when God promiſes mercy to his people, it's ſeal'd with this, <hi>The zeal of the Lord of Hoſts ſhall do it,</hi> 2 King. 19.31.) ſo here is intenſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, wrath againſt his enemies, therefore God beats them off from their own inventions in the ſecond command by this conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he is a jealous God, and his jealouſie extenſive to the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> generation; and <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.22. ſaith God, <hi>A fire is kindled in mine anger, and ſhall burn unto the loweſt hell, and ſhall conſume the earth with her increaſe, and ſet on fire the foundations of the mountains;</hi> and what's the reaſon of this indignation? it's given in <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. <hi>they have moved me to jealouſie with that which is not God;</hi> when God is in his jealouſie, hee ſpeaks dreadfull things, and doth anſwerably; to ſpeak in zeal, is to decree an irrevocable and bloody ſentence:

                  <p>I Have ſpoken of <hi>famine</hi> and <hi>breaking the ſtaffe of bread,</hi> in <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.16. Only I ſhal open unto you, that expreſſion, <hi>The arrows of famine:</hi> they are either the arrows that bring famine, or the arrows that famine brings. The arrows that bring famine are great droughts, Palmer-worms, Locuſts, Canker-worms, Caterpillers, thunder, lightning, winds, ſtorms, immoderate rains, great hails, long froſts, murrains, tranſportations of commodities, monopolizing, hoording up of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, wars, &amp;c. many of theſe are ſhot down from heaven by God, and all are ſent from God, and cauſe famine, and they are call'd arrows, for that they do to the corn, cattell, fruits, and State where they are, what arrows do to the bodies of man or beaſt, wound, diſquiet, conſume; hence, when mention was made of a famine in <hi>Habakkuks</hi> dayes, <hi>Ch.</hi> 3.11. the Lord is ſaid <hi>to march through the land in indignation,</hi> ver. 12. and his bow to be made quite naked, then did God ſhoot amongſt them the arrows of famine.</p>
                  <p>The arrows famine brings, are leanneſs, faintneſs, ſickneſs, loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeneſs, frettings, fears of death, longings for death, gnawings of the ſtomach, pinching of the wind got into the bowels, eating of their own fleſh, thirſting and burning heat, &amp;c. theſe are arrows that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine brings, and kill like arrows ſhot into the liver, which wounding deeply, pain greatly, and kill quickly; and in this ſenſe I rather take it here, becauſe the judgement ſpoken of concerning the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were to be beſieged, if it be taken in the other ſenſe, it would have been a judgement to the beſiegers, who lay in the field, and were not ſo well fortified againſt thoſe arrows, as they within; it is therefore meant of the arrows famine brought upon them chiefly, not excluding the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows brought that famine, namely war, and theſe arrows were prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in <hi>Moſes</hi> dayes, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.23. <hi>I will heap miſchief upon them, I will ſpend mine arrows upon them;</hi> and what arrows? <hi>They ſhall be burnt with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and devoured with burning coals, and with bitter deſtruction,</hi> verſ. 24.
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:123227:249"/> Famine is like a multitude of hot coals in a mans bowels and bones, that cauſe grievous pain, <hi>even bitter deſtruction;</hi> and therefore they are call'd here, <hi>the evill arrows of famine,</hi> becauſe they bring many evils, and at laſt a miſerable death; this <hi>Jeremiah</hi> acknowledges made good, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.12, 13. ſpeaking in the perſon of the Church and State; <hi>Hee hath bent his bow, and ſet me as a mark for the arrow; he hath cauſed the arrow of his quiver to enter into my reins.</hi>

Lions were ſent that ſlew them, they feared not God. But this was paſt, and our Prophet ſpeaks of that was to come. Know then, that as God ſent Lions to deſtroy them there, ſo he could ſend Lions to deſtroy them in <hi>Babylon.</hi> Beſides thoſe Eaſtern countries were not without Lions, <hi>Daniel</hi> was put into the Lions den; and certainly there were Lions, and other evill beaſts to make good what was threatned, whenſoever divine pleaſure would.</p>

To prevent this, and to adde the greater weight to the Prophecy, the Lord takes all upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſaith, It is not <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> but I that am <hi>Jehovah,</hi> who gave being to all creatures, and will give being to my Word, <hi>It is I the Lord have ſpoken it.</hi> Here the Lord ſubſcribes his own Name, acknowledges all his, and that is enough to make all authentike. This Lord, who is dreadfull in threatnings, mighty and faithfull in execution of threats, let all the world fear and give glory unto, before he cauſe darkneſſe.</p>

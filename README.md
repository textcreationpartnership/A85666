Out of the North.

A great cloud.

A fire infolding it ſelfe, &c.

A brightneſſe was about it.

Out of the middeſt thereof as of the colour of amber.

Four living creatures.

The ſole of their feet was like the ſole of a Calves foot.〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

They ſparkled like the colour of burniſhed braſſe.

They ran, and returned.

It went up and down among the living creatures.

It was light, and out of the fire went forth lightening.

They four had one likeneſſe.

Their appearance and their worke was as it were a wheele in the midst of a wheele.

And the rings were full of eyes round about them four, or, on every ſide to them four.

The colour and likeneſſe of it was as the terrible cryſtal.

This was the appearance of the likeneſſe of the Glory of the Lord; and when I ſaw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voyce of one that ſpake.

Bleſſed is the glory of the Lord from his place.

From his place.

And I went in bitterneſſe, in the heat of my ſpirit.

But the hand of the Lord was ſtrong upon me.

I ſate by them, that ſate, and remained there aſtoniſhed ſeven dayes.

Aſtoniſhed.

At the end of ſeven dayes.

A watch-man.

When I ſay unto the wicked.

Thou ſhalt ſurely die.

In his iniquity.

His blood will I require at thy hand.

When a righteous man doth turn from his righteouſneſſe, &c.

Commit iniquity.

And I lay a ſtumbling block before him.

His righteoſneſs ſhall not be remembred.

The hand of the Lord was there upon me.

There.

Goe ſhut thy ſelfe within thy houſe.

Take thee a tile.

Pourtray upon it the Citie, even Jeruſalem.

A ſort.

Caſt a mount againſt it.

Set the Camp;

Set battering rammes againſt it.

Take thee an iron pan, and ſet it for a wall of iron between thee & the city.

The judgements of the Nations.

Judgements.

Becauſe of all thine abominations.

As I live.

Thou haſt defiled my Sanctuary.

Haſt defiled.

With all thy deteſtable things.

Therefore will I alſo diminiſh thee.

Neither ſhall mine eye ſpare.

I will not have any pity.

Peſtilence.

With famine.

By the ſword round about thee.

I will ſcatter a third part into all the winds.

Then ſhall mine anger be accompliſhed.

Be accompliſhed.

I will cauſe my fury to reſt upon them.
